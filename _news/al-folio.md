I migrated my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)/[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) website to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)/[al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) for reasons described in [this blog post](/blog/2023/papermod). In short, PaperMod is missing a lot of necessary (imo) functionality, and existing implementations of these features are suboptimal. Refactoring took less than a day of work because al-folio is super easy to configure and has all necessary features out-of-the-box.

My old Hugo/PaperMod website is still deployed [here](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app) ([source](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod)).
