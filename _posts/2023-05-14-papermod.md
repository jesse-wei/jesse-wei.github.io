## Introduction

I built my old site (not this one) with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

My old site is still accessible via [https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app), and here's the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod). For the rest of this post, I'll refer to it as my (old) PaperMod site.

In this post, I provide an overview of Hugo and PaperMod and describe the modifications I made to the original theme in setting up my old site. Specifically, my [PaperMod_diff page](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/posts/papermod_diff/) shows `diff`s between my site and the original theme in HTML pages, and you should refer to it. Instead of bloating this post with inline code, I'll let you know the relevant files, and you can check out the `diff`s (well-documented, with citations of where I found code from).

I have now switched to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme (though the theme matters a lot more than the static site generator, imo). I provide comparisons of PaperMod and al-folio throughout this post.

## Why did I switch?

Obviously, something must've gone wrong for me to switch. Before I switched, I had kept track of all the changes I made to PaperMod in this post, and I also updated the post a bit. If you'd like to make a PaperMod website and aren't satisfied with its base functionality, then this post would be pretty helpful for you and save you a lot of time.

On the flip side, this post also serves as a review of PaperMod's functionality (rather, all the missing functionality). It's possible to implement these features, as I describe here, but the implementations I found are suboptimal and just not worth the effort, in my opinion.

In short, there are *a ton* of missing features in PaperMod. Check the table of contents on the sidebar under the [My website](#my-website) heading for the important missing features I noticed and implemented or found implementations for. It turns out that implementations of all of these missing features already exist and are submitted in PRs and issues, but the creator of PaperMod rejects the code. I suppose there's value in keeping PaperMod simple and minimal, but I spent several weeks implementing and searching for implementations of these important features. And several implementations I found are suboptimal.

On the other hand, al-folio already implements all of these features well. Switching over to al-folio took a day of work and just involved messing with the config file and copying over the Markdown content, with some minor tweaks. I hardly tweaked the theme itself at all, and I have found only one minor bug so far.

Before proceeding, I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that the creators and contributors of PaperMod and al-folio are all way more skilled than me and have contributed a ton to the community. I think al-folio is better overall, but both themes are great, and making them obviously took a lot more work and skill than writing a little blog post. I'm just sharing my experience and opinions.

### Audience

This post was written with two audiences in mind: people who are new to Hugo and people with Hugo experience. If you're new to Hugo, then I recommend reading this post from start to finish. If you have experience with Hugo, then I recommend skimming. Specifically, I would read [Clone/fork](#clonefork) for setup instructions. Then skip over the [Hugo/PaperMod overview](#overview-of-hugo-and-papermod) to get to [My website](#my-website), which describes specific features of my website. Please see the Table of Contents for an overview.

### Credit

This post is inspired by Konstantin's similarly-titled [blog post](https://kpwn.de/2021/09/how-to-set-up-this-blog/).

## Resources

Before proceeding, I'd like to share five excellent resources that I used and reference throughout this post. The top three are crucial because they cover Hugo and PaperMod. The bottom two describe very specific features that I reference in [My website](#my-website), so don't worry about those yet.

My goal is to make the rest of this post self-contained (and link to brief external resources). If something doesn't make sense, please use the first three resources.

[^5]: [Check links in Hugo with htmltest](https://robb.sh/posts/check-links-in-hugo-with-htmltest/)

As mentioned earlier, I also created PaperMod diff [^10] to show modifications I made to the theme in a readable way. In short, to modify a file from the theme, you create a copy of the file and make edits in the copy, but this makes it hard to see what was modified. So, PaperMod diff shows `diff`s between the files.

## Setup

First, follow the steps [here](https://gohugo.io/installation/) to install Hugo. You should also have Git installed. [^6]

[^6]: I assume you already do, surely.

### Clone/fork

Run these commands.

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules --no-single-branch https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod.git
cd jessewei.dev-PaperMod
hugo server
```

`--recurse-submodule` clones the PaperMod [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Additionally, you may clone with `--depth=1` to save some disk space.

`hugo server` starts up a server for you to view the site.

### Why clone/fork?

At this point, you could start from scratch instead of cloning/forking my website. However, resources [^1] and [^2] already describe how to start from scratch.

So, I'll cut to the chase and have you clone my website and describe changes I made.

If something doesn't make sense, then I recommend first reading/watching the [resources](#resources).

In addition, if you notice some specific feature of my website that I don't explain, then use inspect element to inspect the code for that feature. Then run `grep -ir` in this repo to find the relevant code. `-r` makes the search recursive, and `-i` makes the search case-insensitive. You can also use VSCode's code-searching feature with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F. Lastly, you can also leave a comment below.

## Overview of Hugo and PaperMod

Skim this section or skip to [My website](#my-website) if you're already familiar with Hugo and PaperMod (e.g., if you read/watched the [resources](#resources)).

### Repo structure

Please read [Hugo's directory structure](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/) (3 min) and the top part of [Hugo's content organization](https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/) (1 min) for a general overview of Hugo's directory structure. I'll describe more in-depth below.

Here's the structure of my repository. I omit unimportant stuff and stuff I don't use, and certainly changes will be made, but this is all the important stuff:

```

There are 4 crucial parts of the repo: `config`, `content`, `layouts` and `assets`, and `static`.

### `config.yml`

This is the configuration file for the website containing all site-wide parameters.

### `content/`

This is the directory where site content (posts) goes.

Site content should be Markdown files.

The front matter of a Markdown file contains metadata about the post. For example, the front matter of this post is

```md
---
title: "Overview of Hugo/PaperMod and Setting Up This Site"
date: 2023-05-14T20:13:59-04:00
draft: false
cover:
    image: img/hugo_logo_wide.svg
    alt: "Hugo logo"
    caption: "Hugo logo"
    hidden: false
summary: "This post provides an overview of Hugo (PaperMod theme) and details the steps I took in setting up this website."
tags: ["Hugo", "PaperMod", "Markdown", "HTML", "CSS", "Blog", "Website", "Portfolio"]
---
```

This information is used to generate the post's page. It's quite intuitive what these fields do (check by seeing how something in front matter renders on the page), so I won't go into detail.

For a list of variables you can use, see [Variables | Front Matter](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-variables/#page-variables) from PaperMod documentation.

### `layouts/` and `assets/`

The files in these directories override the files in `themes/PaperMod/layouts/` and `themes/PaperMod/assets/`, respectively. If the path of a file in `layouts/` exactly matches that of a file in `themes/PaperMod/layouts/`, then your site will use the file in `layouts/` instead of the one in `themes/PaperMod/layouts/`. Same for `assets/`.

Essentially, `themes/PaperMod/layouts/` and `themes/PaperMod/assets/` specify defaults. If you want to make a change, override the default in your own repo.

`layouts/` contains HTML files that specify the structure of pages.

Let's look at `PaperMod/layouts/_default/`.

```text
themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default
├── _markup
├── archives.html
├── baseof.html
├── index.json
├── list.html
├── rss.xml
├── search.html
├── single.html
└── terms.html
```

#### baseof

In particular, here's `baseof.html`. Note that double braces `{ { } }` (without space between braces) are used in the actual code, but I will be using single braces from now on so the code can be correctly rendered in this page.

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{ site.Language }" dir="{ .Language.LanguageDirection | default "auto" }">

<head>
    {- partial "head.html" . }
</head>

<body class="
{- if (or (ne .Kind `page` ) (eq .Layout `archives`) (eq .Layout `search`)) -}
{- print "list" -}
{- end -}
{- if eq site.Params.defaultTheme `dark` -}
{- print " dark" }
{- end -}
" id="top">
    {- partialCached "header.html" . .Page -}
    <main class="main">
        {- block "main" . }{ end }
    </main>
    { partialCached "footer.html" . .Layout .Kind (.Param "hideFooter") (.Param "ShowCodeCopyButtons") -}
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

This is the base template for all pages. Notice it has all parts of an HTML document: `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.

It's mostly HTML. However, note the code in braces `{ { ... } }` or `{ {- ... -} }`. This is [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) code. It's a templating language that Hugo uses to generate HTML.

Note on line 2 that a [site variable](https://gohugo.io/variables/site/) `site.Language` is directly inserted into an HTML attribute. Some site variables are in `config.yml`, and others are built-in to Hugo.

Note on line 5 that a partial `head.html` is inserted. A partial is an HTML snippet that can be inserted into a page. As we can see here, the partial `head.html` (which can be found under `layouts/partials/head.html`) is the `<head>` code of all pages.

Does this mean all pages have the same `<head>` code?

Nope, notice one last thing on line 9: conditionals! By checking the values of some variables, we can conditionally insert HTML code. Lines 9-14 just insert some classes, but it's also possible to insert entire HTML snippets or partials. So although all pages have the same template for `<head>`, the actual `<head>` code depends on parameters.

On lines 16 and 20, we see partials defining the header and footer of a page. In the middle is `<main>` for the content of a page. All files in `_default` except `baseof.html` define `<main>`.

#### single

Most pages are singles (`layouts/_default/single.html`). For example, this post on my [original site](https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/posts/setup_site/) is a single.

A portion of `single.html` is below.

```html
{- define "main" }

<article class="post-single">
  <header class="post-header">
    { partial "breadcrumbs.html" . }
    <h1 class="post-title">
      { .Title }
      {- if .Draft }<sup><span class="entry-isdraft">&nbsp;&nbsp;[draft]</span></sup>{- end }
    </h1>
    {- if .Description }
    <div class="post-description">
      { .Description }
    </div>
    {- end }
    {- if not (.Param "hideMeta") }
    <div class="post-meta">
      {- partial "post_meta.html" . -}
      {- partial "translation_list.html" . -}
      {- partial "edit_post.html" . -}
      {- partial "post_canonical.html" . -}
<!-- Rest of code omitted -->
```

Notice this code goes in the `"main"` block from line 17 of `baseof.html`. You could inspect element a single page on my old PaperMod site to confirm. The code is quite intuitive, so you should be able to see how this code (in addition to front matter and site variables) causes certain elements to appear at the top of the page.

#### Specifying layout of a page

You should rarely have to manually specify the `layout` of a page in front matter. Hugo determines whether a page is a single or list by directory structure. Most pages should be singles, of course.

You can see an example of a list layout at my [projects](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/projects/) page. However, I did not specify this layout manually: It's automatically a list layout because `projects/` has directories but no `index.md` file.

```text
content/projects
├── 566
├── leds
├── mips_emulator
├── neuroruler
├── rubiks_541
└── sapsim
```

I have two pages where I manually set the layout in front matter. One is [Search](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/search/), and the other is [Archives](https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/archives/).

Here's the front matter of `search.md`, and it's similar for `archives.md`.

```md
---
title: "Search"
layout: "search"
summary: "search"
---
```

This topic is further described in [Content](#content-1).

### `static/`

The fourth and final important part is `static/`. This is where static files, such as images, go.

I don't have very many images here because I prefer to group images with the post itself in `content/`.

Note that after compilation, files in `static/` are copied to the root directory `/`. So, when accessing a file in `static/`, you should prepend a `/` to the file path. For example, the image `static/1.jpg` should be accessed as `/1.jpg`. In practice, I've found that the leading `/` can often be omitted. Just know that something like `/static/1.jpg` won't work.

### Logo

Site logos are configured in two places in the config.

```yml
params:
  # OpenGraph image displayed when posting site link on socials
  # For example, if you post the link to the site in Discord, this image will be displayed
  # This image is used with <meta property="og:image" ...> and <meta property="twitter:image" ...>
  images: ["logo_outlined_6.png"]

  # ...

  # Logo and name shown on top left of site
  label:
    text: "Jesse Wei"
    icon: /logo_filled_outlined_6.png
    iconHeight: 35
```

It's pretty self-explanatory. I do want to show an example of how the website looks when posted in Discord.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/papermod/social_logo.jpg" title="OpenGraph image Discord" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">OpenGraph image in Discord</div>

### Favicons

See the [PaperMod documentation](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-faq/#adding-custom-favicons). [favicon.io](https://favicon.io) is very convenient for generating favicons!

### Shortcodes

I want to mention [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/). There are times when you need raw HTML (e.g., figure with centered caption, YouTube video embed, etc.), and shortcodes are shortcodes for doing so. Quite a few are [built in to Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) and PaperMod, and they're very convenient.

Shortcodes are not built-in to al-folio, to my knowledge, however. In al-folio, the convention is just to inline the raw HTML, so that's what I'll be doing to replicate the result of the shortcodes (see my old PaperMod site for the actual results). If you inspect the source code, then you'll see how convenient shortcodes are!

#### Raw HTML

```html
{< rawhtml >}
<p align="center"><strong>This is raw HTML</strong></p>
{< /rawhtml >}
```

<p align="center"><strong>This is raw HTML</strong></p>

#### Figure

```html
{ < figure src="img/social_logo.jpg" caption="OpenGraph image Discord" alt="OpenGraph image Discord" align="center">}
```

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/papermod/social_logo.jpg" title="OpenGraph image Discord" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">OpenGraph image in Discord</div>

[Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure)

#### YouTube embed

```text
{ < youtube hjD9jTi_DQ4 >}
```

{% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hjD9jTi_DQ4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" center=1 %}

The YouTube embed looks a lot better in PaperMod than it does in al-folio.

### Deploy

Resource 2 describes how to deploy a Hugo site to Netlify. Here's a [timestamp](https://youtu.be/hjD9jTi_DQ4?t=2230) for that portion of the video.

The build process is incredibly simple. In the video, the only command you input for the build process is `hugo`.

My build process involves slightly more than just `hugo` since I also have to build PaperMod_diff [^10]. So, I use [scripts/netlify](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/scripts/netlify). My build command in Site settings > Build & deploy > Build command is `chmod +x scripts/netlify;./scripts/netlify`.

You can ignore that unless you also want to set up a PaperMod_diff page.

#### al-folio comparison

al-folio deployment is easier because it already includes a GH action for deploying to GH pages. You just need to name your repo {your GH username}.github.io and follow some other steps in the README.

However, deploying the site locally on an M1 MacBook was a huge pain in the ass. For some reason, deploying via Docker wasn't working, which is super weird. Then Ruby and Jekyll installation was not straightforward. I eventually got local deployment to work after following this YouTube video.

{% include video.html path="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKB9ylw0G4U" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" center=1 %}

## My website

Now I'll describe specific features of my website.

### config.yml

The latest version of my `config.yml` is [here](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/config.yml).

I think I use reasonable values, and I use comments to explain decisions I consider non-obvious. I'll explain some specific decisions I made in this file in the below sections as they come up.

#### al-folio comparison

I was very confused by the meanings of several parameters in PaperMod's `config.yml` and had to read PaperMod's documentation about several parameters. Plus, there are some super weird things that I had to modify. For example, my `/teaching` page had the page title `Teachings` even though the URL was `"teaching"`, which was super confusing. After Googling, it turns out I had to set `pluralizeListTitles` to `false`, but this parameter doesn't even exist in PaperMod's base `config.yml`? In addition, this is obviously a feature that should be off by default, so I'm not sure why it's enabled by default.

al-folio's `config.yml` is commented super well, and I had no issues.

### PaperMod diff

I created PaperMod diff [^10] using the scripts in [scripts/](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/tree/main/scripts). `diff.py` runs `diff` between corresponding files, `helpers/generate_directory_index_caddystyle.py` creates `index.html` files recursively, and `build` wraps `diff.py` to deploy its output to Netlify (see [Deploy](#deploy)). `helpers/cd.py` is also used.

Do note that `content/posts/papermod_diff` is [gitignored](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/.gitignore). This is because if it weren't, then the content there would change and be shown on GitHub every time I modify `assets/` and/or `layouts/`, which is redundant and would make the commit history harder to read. My solution (gitignore the folder and generate it during the build process in Netlify) is a bit roundabout, but it's already implemented and works well.

### Content

This section is a continuation of [Specifying layout of a page](#specifying-layout-of-a-page).

Let's look more closely at the structure of `content/teaching`, which is a list layout.

```text
content/teaching
├── act               List layout within list layout
│   ├── _index.md     Note, _index.md, not index.md!
│   ├── binary
│   ├── desmos
│   ├── eulers_formula
│   ├── ...
├── comp110
│   ├── img
│   └── index.md
├── comp210
│   ├── img
│   └── index.md
└── comp311
    ├── img
    ├── index.md
    └── review
```

My [Teaching](https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/) page has a list layout because `teaching/` doesn't have an `index.md`. The `comp110/` directory is a single because it has an `index.md`. It's accessible by [/teaching/comp110](https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/comp110). It also contains an `img/` directory that's accessible from `index.md`. The images could go in `/static/`, but I prefer bundling them with the page.

It's possible to have a list layout within a list layout, and [/teaching/act](https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/act) is an example. However, notice `act/` must have an `_index.md` file (note the underscore) since it's a non-leaf.

See [Page Bundles](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) for more details.

#### al-folio comparison

Honestly, this was (and still is) a bit confusing to me. I can see how it is more organized, but I don't see why it's necessary.

al-folio's directory structure feels just like that of a raw HTML and CSS website and was much easier to get used to.

### $$\LaTeX{}$$

I enabled $$\LaTeX{}$$ via [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) in `layouts/partials/extend_head.html`.

I followed [Math Typesetting](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/math-typesetting/) from PaperMod documentation. Specifically, the code in `extend_head.html` is mostly from [Issue #236](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/236#issuecomment-778936434).

I modified the condition for loading the KaTeX script. The site param `math` must be true. Then KaTeX will be loaded by default in all pages. Setting the local param `math` to `false` in front matter will cause that page to not load KaTeX.

I think having to opt-in is super annoying, so I'd rather enable it globally and be able to opt-out.

#### al-folio comparison

al-folio uses MathJax by default. As shown [here](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php), MathJax is on par or faster than KaTeX. In my experience, MathJax is also less restrictive.

### Comments

I enabled comments using [giscus](https://giscus.app).

I followed the directions on the giscus site to install giscus in my repo and pasted code from the giscus website into `layouts/partials/comments.html`. I also added `comments: true` to config.

As you can see, there are comments at the bottom of almost every page. PaperMod automatically disables comments in the index profile, search, and archives layouts. I manually disabled comments in my [Privacy policy](https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/privacy/) page in the front matter with `comments: false`.

Comments show up in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/discussions). Make sure to [enable Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository#) in your GitHub repo.

However, the comment box does not automatically change color on theme toggle if all you do is add the script. I found an implementation online for it, and it's in `layouts/partials/comments.html`.

#### al-folio comparison

al-folio implements giscus (and Disqus, deprecated) by default. The only change needed is some configuration in `config.yml`. In addition, the comment box automatically toggles color when the theme is toggled.

### Social icons in footer

I added social icons to the footer, as in resource [^4]. I sort of follow what it describes but make some of my own adjustments.

As described there, adding social icons to footer messes with CSS spacing values. For example, a scrollbar appeared on the homepage and Search page (haven't solved this and don't plan to) even though there's enough room for both header and footer to be visible without scrolling. This issue is described more in-depth in resource [^4], under problem 2.

In short, I modified CSS in 4 files. `layouts/partials/footer.html`, `layouts/partials/social_icons.html`, `assets/css/core/theme-vars.css`, and `assets/css/common/profile-mode.css`. The comments in each file describe the changes I made. Most comments in `social_icons.html` are for htmltest, described [below](#ci), so ignore those for now.

I disabled footer social icons on the homepage because the homepage already has social icons.

#### al-folio comparison

I didn't bother with this since al-folio puts social icons in the footer of the homepage by default. That's fine with me.

### Other footer changes

Beyond that, I made some other minor changes to the footer.

I added the separator character • between phrases in the footer.

The links were originally like this:

```html
Powered by
<a href="https://gohugo.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hugo</a> &
<a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PaperMod</a>
```

I removed `target=_blank` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` because [links should not usually open new tabs](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html).

I added a privacy policy page and a link to it in the footer.

Lastly, I removed "Powered by Hugo and PaperMod" in the homepage specifically to keep it minimal.

#### al-folio comparison

It's much easier to change the text of the al-folio footer because you need only edit `config.yml`.

However, it seems that all external links open in new tabs in al-folio. Personally, I don't like that, but I get that the purpose is to get the user to stay on your site. It's fine with me since the behavior is consistent, but I might end up changing this.

### Single

I slightly modified `layouts/_default/single.html`. I moved the ToC above the cover. Notice on this page that the ToC is above the cover image.

### Links are Carolina blue on hover

This was just basic CSS.

I modified CSS in the following CSS files in `assets/css/common/`: `archive`, `footer`, `header`, `main`, `post-entry`, and `post-single`.

For example, `main.css` has these important lines:

```css
/* Change color on hover */
a:hover {
    color: var(--carolina_blue);
}

a.anchor:hover {
    color: var(--carolina_blue) !important;
}

svg:hover {
    color: var(--carolina_blue);
}
```

For modifications, look for comments and the variable `carolina_blue`. Check PaperMod diff.

Since I made links blue on hover, I removed underline on hover (the link is still underlined if it had an underline before hovering though).

#### al-folio comparison

al-folio colors links and underlines on hover by default. All I did was change the theme colors to UNC blue in `_sass/_variables.scss` and `_sass/_themes.scss`.

### Syntax highlighting via Chroma

I disabled [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) (default) and enabled Hugo Chroma following the [steps in PaperMod documentation](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-faq/#using-hugos-syntax-highlighter-chroma). This required a few changes in `config.yml` and `assets/css/extended/*.css`.

I disabled line numbers by default in `config.yml` for readability. Most code blocks you've seen so far have not had line numbers.

However, you can enable line numbers for a specific code block, as shown in the [baseof](#baseof) code block, by adding `{lineNos=true}` to the code block. [^7]

[^7]: You might also be able to enable it by default in a specific post by adding it to front matter, but this didn't work for me.

It was very easy to install just one Chroma theme. However, I also wanted the code theme to toggle when the theme toggles. This should've been decently easy because all I had to do was a second stylesheet with a dark code theme and add `.dark` to the class names. However, I ran into a lot of issues with the light theme CSS overriding the dark theme CSS for most combinations of themes. It could've been a fault in my implementation, but without changing anything, the specific combination of pygments (light) and dracula (dark) didn't have any issues, so I'm not sure what was going on.

Plus, there's a second issue. Line numbers on code blocks look weird.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/papermod/code_line_nos.jpg" title="Line numbers on code blocks look weird" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">Line numbers rectangle has a rounded edge by <code>DOCTYPE</code> and /body</div>

#### al-folio comparison

Everything works well by default! I changed `$code-bg-color-light` in `sass/_variables.scss`, but I think that's it.

However, Hugo's code syntax highlighter supports `go-html-template` (I just specify `html` or `text` in this post) and `arduino`, whereas Jekyll's doesn't. In addition, in PaperMod, I didn't have to convert double braces to single braces inside code blocks like I had to do in this post.

### Table of Contents

This one is quite important to me but is horrible to implement on PaperMod.

On this post, notice the ToC on the side (if your screen is wide enough) that automatically changes color to show you where you are in the post. In addition, since there's not enough room to show all the headings, it only shows all the top-level headings and expands the lower-level headings of the heading you're currently on. I think this is a very good feature for organization too since you don't get much out of seeing lower-level headings if you're not reading that section.

There's a [fork](https://reorx.github.io/hugo-PaperModX/docs/papermodx-new-features/) of PaperMod called PaperModX that roughly implements this. However, it is not a good implementation, and that's the best implementation I found (compared to two others in a PaperMod PR and a PaperMod issue). That implementation will show all headings and will display a scrollbar (such as on this page in my PaperMod website) if there are too many headings. It does highlight the active heading, but if there's a scrollbar, then it won't scroll down when you get to the bottom, and the active element feature will then break completely. [GH issue with more information](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/25).

If you're somehow still interested in implementing this feature in PaperMod, then the relevant code is in `assets/css/common/post-single.css` (for putting the ToC on the side and hiding it on small screens), `layouts/partials/footer.html` (for a short script - I'm not sure what it does), and `layouts/partials/toc.html` (adds a few classes to the `toc` div and the script for scrolling and keeping track of the active ToC element). Check PaperMod diff [^10].

#### al-folio comparison

The Bootstrap ToC plugin just works! See the [documentation](https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2023/sidebar-table-of-contents/).

The only thing I would change is that on small screens, the side ToC (if enabled) disappears, and there's nothing to replace it. In the implementation described above, if there's not a side ToC, then the ToC is at the top of the post (as in normal PaperMod).

I did check what happens with the Bootstrap ToC when there are enough headings to fill the screen by resizing my window. There is no scrollbar, and the ToC just overflows the screen and is cut off. However, realistically speaking, this should never occur, and even if it does, the top-level headings will still be shown.

### Hamburger/responsive menu

There should be a hamburger menu for small screens. Several people asked for an implementation of this, but Aditya refuses to merge the change. What's funny is he implemented it himself and sent the relevant code in Discord but chooses not to merge it into the repo...?

Here's the [commit](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/commit/9d74c542e64699557cda562edacacccc700cd3c8) where I copied in the code, and here's the relevant [issue](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/discussions/943).

#### al-folio comparison

You'll never guess...

al-folio supports this by default. In addition, al-folio also supports dropdown menus and allows you to choose between sticky and fixed header and footer.

### Miscellaneous bugs and shortcomings

#### PaperMod

The scrollbar is bugged on Safari. [More information and a fix](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/22). This is a problem with the original theme.

Link underlines either disappear or turn the wrong color on theme toggle. [More information](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/23), and I have not found a solution for this. This is a problem on PaperMod's site too.

This isn't really a bug, but in PaperMod, if you use a footnote more than once, then the footnote at the bottom of the post will just specify ↩ ↩ ↩ ..., one arrow for each footnote reference. However, al-folio specifies ↩ ↩2 ↩3 ...

#### al-folio

Have found only one bug! So far... 🤞

On the sidebar ToC, at least with a sticky navbar, if you click a heading, then the page will scroll such that the heading is at the top of the page, and the navbar above that. However, the active ToC element probably won't be the heading you clicked on because the sticky navbar above takes up some space, so the script thinks the active element is the heading above the one you clicked on.

This isn't a bug, but I would like it if the side ToC ignores the automatically-generated heading "Enjoy Reading This Article?"

### Google Analytics

For Google Analytics, just add your Google Analytics tag to `googleAnalytics` in the config. For example, mine has `googleAnalytics: G-Q603T56FWT`.

PaperMod automatically uses the Google Analytics script if `env` is `production` (default). See the bottom of `layouts/partials/head.html`:

```text
{- /* Misc */}
{- if hugo.IsProduction | or (eq site.Params.env "production") }
{- template "_internal/google_analytics.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/opengraph.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/twitter_cards.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/schema_json.html" . }
{- end -}
```

#### al-folio comparison

al-folio also has Google Analytics by default.

### CI

I added a GH workflow for checking links in my site and spellcheck. This is not directly related to PaperMod and al-folio.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/papermod/htmltest.jpg" title="htmltest GH Action output" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">htmltest GH Action output</div>

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and its configuration file `.github/.htmltest.yml`. This follows resource [^5], with some modifications. In particular, I want to note that I run my `scripts/build` in `ci.yml` instead of just `hugo`, as in the original file.

#### Behavior

Here is the intended behavior of the htmltest job after making the modifications below.

If an internal link (e.g., a page or image) doesn't work, the workflow will fail, causing a red X to appear on GH Actions.

If an external link doesn't work, htmltest will warn, but the workflow will not fail. That is, an external link could be "broken," and a green checkmark will be shown on GH Actions. This is fine because when using a lot of external links, it's unlikely that all will work in any single run. There could be a timeout or non-200 HTML response code, etc.. Getting a red X when just a single external link breaks is annoying. htmltest does still warn, so I manually check GH actions every now and then.

#### Getting rid of garbage output

There was originally >100 lines of garbage output. htmltest complained that the site logo's link at the top left had no alt text, and my LinkedIn link in social icons in the footer returned non-OK exit status 999. Since the header and footer are in all pages, this caused a lot of errors, which made the output unreadable.

I fixed this in `layouts/partials/header.html` by adding non-empty alt text to the logo and in `layouts/partials/social_icons.html` by excluding the LinkedIn link from htmltest using the `data-proofer-ignore` attribute, as specified in [htmltest's README](https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest#see_no_evil-ignoring-content).

The top 3 links are ones I want to keep even though they don't actually work. So I manually ignored them in the post (not `layouts/`) using the `data-proofer-ignore` attribute in rawhtml. [^8]

[^8]: TODO: Create shortcode for a link with `data-proofer-ignore` attribute.

And the `#center` thing is how you can [center an image in Markdown syntax in PaperMod](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-faq/#centering-image-in-markdown). `#center` also gets appended to an image URL if you use `align="center"` in figure shortcode. But since this causes htmltest to freak out, I added this to `.htmltest.yml`:

```yml
IgnoreURLs:
  # Ignore <img src="*#center"> for centered images in PaperMod, which would cause "hash not found"
  # This is suboptimal because we ideally want to check the image URL without the #center suffix

  # Match internal image path ending in #center
  - .*\.(apng|gif|ico|cur|jpg|jpeg|jfif|pjpeg|pjp|png|svg)#center$$
  # Match external image URL ending in #center
  - (https://|http://|www\.).*\.[A-Za-z]+#center$$
```

As you can tell by the comments, this is suboptimal and can lead to false negatives. I can think of two solutions.

1. Modify htmltest to ignore specific hashes but check the rest of the URL [^9]
2. Modify PaperMod to center the image without appending `#center`

[^9]: This would ignore any URL with `#center` suffix, not just image URLs.

#### Make GH Actions display red X on failure

Instead of `continue-on-error: true` from resource [^5], I use `if: always()`.

```yml
- name: Test HTML
  # https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest-action/
  uses: wjdp/htmltest-action@master
  with:
    config: ./.github/.htmltest.yml
- name: Archive htmltest results
  # Archive result even if Test HTML fails
  # Use if: always() instead of continue-on-error, as in the original file
  # Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62045967/github-actions-is-there-a-way-to-continue-on-error-while-still-getting-correct
  if: always()
```

`if: always()` will cause logging to occur even if Test HTML fails. `continue-on-error: true` does the same. However, `continue-on-error: true` would cause GH Actions to display a green checkmark when Test HTML fails, which is misleading.

#### IgnoreExternalBrokenLinks

I added this to `.htmltest.yml`:

```yml
# This does not "ignore" the broken links, but it does not fail the action
# From the htmltest README:
# When true produces a warning, rather than an error, for broken external links.
IgnoreExternalBrokenLinks: true
```

With a lot of external links, it's unlikely that all external links will work during any one run. Maybe there'll be a timeout or bad HTML response code, etc.

## Conclusion

There are definitely some other modifications I made to PaperMod that I didn't describe here, but these are the major points.

I think this post pretty much confirms 100% that, at the moment, Jekyll + al-folio is better than Hugo + PaperMod. Looking into the future, however, Hugo is growing a lot faster than Jekyll is (and imho, it overall does feel better than Jekyll). I can't be sure if I made an optimal long-term choice, but al-folio is really dang good, and I don't think I'll have to completely refactor my website again any time soon.

If you're using PaperMod, then I hope this post makes it easy for you add some of the necessary features. However, whether you're using PaperMod or deciding whether to use it or anything else, I hope you consider al-folio!
