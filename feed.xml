<p>I built my old site (not this one) with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod">PaperMod</a> and hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>

<p>My old site is still accessible via <a href="https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app">https://main–cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app</a>, and here’s the <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod">GitHub repo</a>. For the rest of this post, I’ll refer to it as my (old) PaperMod site.</p>

<p>In this post, I provide an overview of Hugo and PaperMod and describe the modifications I made to the original theme in setting up my old site. Specifically, my <a href="https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/posts/papermod_diff/">PaperMod_diff page</a> shows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code>s between my site and the original theme in HTML pages, and you should refer to it. Instead of bloating this post with inline code, I’ll let you know the relevant files, and you can check out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code>s (well-documented, with citations of where I found code from).</p>

<p>I have now switched to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme (though the theme matters a lot more than the static site generator, imo). I provide comparisons of PaperMod and al-folio throughout this post.</p>

<h2 id="why-did-i-switch">Why did I switch?</h2>

<p>Obviously, something must’ve gone wrong for me to switch. Before I switched, I had kept track of all the changes I made to PaperMod in this post, and I also updated the post a bit. If you’d like to make a PaperMod website and aren’t satisfied with its base functionality, then this post would be pretty helpful for you and save you a lot of time.</p>

<p>On the flip side, this post also serves as a review of PaperMod’s functionality (rather, all the missing functionality). It’s possible to implement these features, as I describe here, but the implementations I found are suboptimal and just not worth the effort, in my opinion.</p>

<p>In short, there are <em>a ton</em> of missing features in PaperMod. Check the table of contents on the sidebar under the <a href="#my-website">My website</a> heading for the important missing features I noticed and implemented or found implementations for. It turns out that implementations of all of these missing features already exist and are submitted in PRs and issues, but the creator of PaperMod rejects the code. I suppose there’s value in keeping PaperMod simple and minimal, but I spent several weeks implementing and searching for implementations of these important features. And several implementations I found are suboptimal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, al-folio already implements all of these features well. Switching over to al-folio took a day of work and just involved messing with the config file and copying over the Markdown content, with some minor tweaks. I hardly tweaked the theme itself at all, and I have found only one minor bug so far.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, I want to preface the rest of this post by saying that the creators and contributors of PaperMod and al-folio are all way more skilled than me and have contributed a ton to the community. I think al-folio is better overall, but both themes are great, and making them obviously took a lot more work and skill than writing a little blog post. I’m just sharing my experience and opinions.</p>

<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>

<p>This post was written with two audiences in mind: people who are new to Hugo and people with Hugo experience. If you’re new to Hugo, then I recommend reading this post from start to finish. If you have experience with Hugo, then I recommend skimming. Specifically, I would read <a href="#clonefork">Clone/fork</a> for setup instructions. Then skip over the <a href="#overview-of-hugo-and-papermod">Hugo/PaperMod overview</a> to get to <a href="#my-website">My website</a>, which describes specific features of my website. Please see the Table of Contents for an overview.</p>

<h3 id="credit">Credit</h3>

<p>This post is inspired by Konstantin’s similarly-titled <a href="https://kpwn.de/2021/09/how-to-set-up-this-blog/">blog post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>Before proceeding, I’d like to share five excellent resources that I used and reference throughout this post. The top three are crucial because they cover Hugo and PaperMod. The bottom two describe very specific features that I reference in <a href="#my-website">My website</a>, so don’t worry about those yet.</p>

<p>My goal is to make the rest of this post self-contained (and link to brief external resources). If something doesn’t make sense, please use the first three resources.</p>

<ul>
  <li><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start">Hugo Quick Start</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Super quick to read and follow along, &lt; 5 min.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjD9jTi_DQ4">Getting Started With Hugo</a> (47:41)</li>
  <li><sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/">PaperMod demo site/documentation</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite">source</a></li>
  <li><sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> <a href="https://kpwn.de/2021/09/how-to-set-up-this-blog/">Konstantin’s How to Set Up This Blog</a></li>
  <li><sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> <a href="https://robb.sh/posts/check-links-in-hugo-with-htmltest/">Check links in Hugo with htmltest</a></li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I also created PaperMod diff <sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> to show modifications I made to the theme in a readable way. In short, to modify a file from the theme, you create a copy of the file and make edits in the copy, but this makes it hard to see what was modified. So, PaperMod diff shows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code>s between the files.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>First, follow the steps <a href="https://gohugo.io/installation/">here</a> to install Hugo. You should also have Git installed. <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="clonefork">Clone/fork</h3>

<p>Run these commands.</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone <span class="nt">--recurse-submodules</span> <span class="nt">--no-single-branch</span> https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod.git
<span class="nb">cd </span>jessewei.dev-PaperMod
hugo server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--recurse-submodule</code> clones the PaperMod <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">submodule</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, you may clone with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--depth=1</code> to save some disk space.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo server</code> starts up a server for you to view the site.</p>

<h3 id="why-clonefork">Why clone/fork?</h3>

<p>At this point, you could start from scratch instead of cloning/forking my website. However, resources <sup id="fnref:1:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and <sup id="fnref:2:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> already describe how to start from scratch.</p>

<p>So, I’ll cut to the chase and have you clone my website and describe changes I made.</p>

<p>If something doesn’t make sense, then I recommend first reading/watching the <a href="#resources">resources</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, if you notice some specific feature of my website that I don’t explain, then use inspect element to inspect the code for that feature. Then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep -ir</code> in this repo to find the relevant code. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-r</code> makes the search recursive, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-i</code> makes the search case-insensitive. You can also use VSCode’s code-searching feature with Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F. Lastly, you can also leave a comment below.</p>

<h2 id="overview-of-hugo-and-papermod">Overview of Hugo and PaperMod</h2>

<p>Skim this section or skip to <a href="#my-website">My website</a> if you’re already familiar with Hugo and PaperMod (e.g., if you read/watched the <a href="#resources">resources</a>).</p>

<h3 id="repo-structure">Repo structure</h3>

<p>Please read <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/directory-structure/">Hugo’s directory structure</a> (3 min) and the top part of <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/organization/">Hugo’s content organization</a> (1 min) for a general overview of Hugo’s directory structure. I’ll describe more in-depth below.</p>

<p>Here’s the structure of my repository. I omit unimportant stuff and stuff I don’t use, and certainly changes will be made, but this is all the important stuff:</p>

<p>There are 4 crucial parts of the repo: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static</code>.</p>

<h3 id="configyml"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code></h3>

<p>This is the configuration file for the website containing all site-wide parameters.</p>

<h3 id="content"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content/</code></h3>

<p>This is the directory where site content (posts) goes.</p>

<p>Site content should be Markdown files.</p>

<p>The front matter of a Markdown file contains metadata about the post. For example, the front matter of this post is</p>

<p>This information is used to generate the post’s page. It’s quite intuitive what these fields do (check by seeing how something in front matter renders on the page), so I won’t go into detail.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>For a list of variables you can use, see [Variables</td>
      <td>Front Matter](https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-variables/#page-variables) from PaperMod documentation.</td>

<h3 id="layouts-and-assets"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/</code></h3>

<p>The files in these directories override the files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/layouts/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/assets/</code>, respectively. If the path of a file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code> exactly matches that of a file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/layouts/</code>, then your site will use the file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code> instead of the one in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/layouts/</code>. Same for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/</code>.</p>

<p>Essentially, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/layouts/</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">themes/PaperMod/assets/</code> specify defaults. If you want to make a change, override the default in your own repo.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code> contains HTML files that specify the structure of pages.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PaperMod/layouts/_default/</code>.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>themes/PaperMod/layouts/_default
├── _markup
├── archives.html
├── baseof.html
├── index.json
├── list.html
├── rss.xml
├── search.html
├── single.html
└── terms.html
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="baseof">baseof</h4>

<p>In particular, here’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseof.html</code>. Note that double braces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ { } }</code> (without space between braces) are used in the actual code, but I will be using single braces from now on so the code can be correctly rendered in this page.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;html</span> <span class="na">lang=</span><span class="s">"{ site.Language }"</span> <span class="na">dir=</span><span class="s">"{ .Language.LanguageDirection | default "</span><span class="na">auto</span><span class="err">"</span> <span class="err">}"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="err">{</span><span class="na">-</span> <span class="na">end</span> <span class="na">-</span><span class="err">}</span>
<span class="err">"</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"top"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    {- partialCached "header.html" . .Page -}
    <span class="nt">&lt;main</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"main"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        {- block "main" . }{ end }
    <span class="nt">&lt;/main&gt;</span>
    { partialCached "footer.html" . .Layout .Kind (.Param "hideFooter") (.Param "ShowCodeCopyButtons") -}
<span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is the base template for all pages. Notice it has all parts of an HTML document: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;body&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>It’s mostly HTML. However, note the code in braces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ { ... } }</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{ {- ... -} }</code>. This is <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go template</a> code. It’s a templating language that Hugo uses to generate HTML.</p>

<p>Note on line 2 that a <a href="https://gohugo.io/variables/site/">site variable</a> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.Language</code> is directly inserted into an HTML attribute. Some site variables are in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>, and others are built-in to Hugo.</p>

<p>Note on line 5 that a partial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head.html</code> is inserted. A partial is an HTML snippet that can be inserted into a page. As we can see here, the partial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head.html</code> (which can be found under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/head.html</code>) is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> code of all pages.</p>

<p>Does this mean all pages have the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> code?</p>

<p>Nope, notice one last thing on line 9: conditionals! By checking the values of some variables, we can conditionally insert HTML code. Lines 9-14 just insert some classes, but it’s also possible to insert entire HTML snippets or partials. So although all pages have the same template for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code>, the actual <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;head&gt;</code> code depends on parameters.</p>

<p>On lines 16 and 20, we see partials defining the header and footer of a page. In the middle is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code> for the content of a page. All files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_default</code> except <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseof.html</code> define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;main&gt;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="single">single</h4>

<p>Most pages are singles (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/_default/single.html</code>). For example, this post on my <a href="https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/posts/setup_site/">original site</a> is a single.</p>

<p>A portion of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">single.html</code> is below.</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{- define "main" }

<span class="nt">&lt;article</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-single"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;header</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-header"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    { partial "breadcrumbs.html" . }
    <span class="nt">&lt;h1</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-title"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      { .Title }
      {- if .Draft }<span class="nt">&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"entry-isdraft"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</span>[draft]<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;</span>{- end }
    <span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    {- if .Description }
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-description"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      { .Description }
    <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
    {- end }
    {- if not (.Param "hideMeta") }
    <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"post-meta"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      {- partial "post_meta.html" . -}
      {- partial "translation_list.html" . -}
      {- partial "edit_post.html" . -}
      {- partial "post_canonical.html" . -}
<span class="c">&lt;!-- Rest of code omitted --&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice this code goes in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"main"</code> block from line 17 of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">baseof.html</code>. You could inspect element a single page on my old PaperMod site to confirm. The code is quite intuitive, so you should be able to see how this code (in addition to front matter and site variables) causes certain elements to appear at the top of the page.</p>

<h4 id="specifying-layout-of-a-page">Specifying layout of a page</h4>

<p>You should rarely have to manually specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layout</code> of a page in front matter. Hugo determines whether a page is a single or list by directory structure. Most pages should be singles, of course.</p>

<p>You can see an example of a list layout at my <a href="https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/projects/">projects</a> page. However, I did not specify this layout manually: It’s automatically a list layout because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">projects/</code> has directories but no <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code> file.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>content/projects
├── 566
├── leds
├── mips_emulator
├── neuroruler
├── rubiks_541
└── sapsim
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have two pages where I manually set the layout in front matter. One is <a href="https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/search/">Search</a>, and the other is <a href="https://main--cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/archives/">Archives</a>.</p>

<p>Here’s the front matter of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search.md</code>, and it’s similar for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archives.md</code>.</p>

<div class="language-md highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Search"</span>
<span class="na">layout</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">search"</span>
<span class="na">summary</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">search"</span>
<span class="nn">---</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This topic is further described in <a href="#content-1">Content</a>.</p>

<h3 id="static"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static/</code></h3>

<p>The fourth and final important part is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static/</code>. This is where static files, such as images, go.</p>

<p>I don’t have very many images here because I prefer to group images with the post itself in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content/</code>.</p>

<p>Note that after compilation, files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static/</code> are copied to the root directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>. So, when accessing a file in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static/</code>, you should prepend a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> to the file path. For example, the image <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">static/1.jpg</code> should be accessed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/1.jpg</code>. In practice, I’ve found that the leading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> can often be omitted. Just know that something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/static/1.jpg</code> won’t work.</p>

<h3 id="logo">Logo</h3>

<p>Site logos are configured in two places in the config.</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">params</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="c1"># OpenGraph image displayed when posting site link on socials</span>
  <span class="c1"># For example, if you post the link to the site in Discord, this image will be displayed</span>
  <span class="c1"># This image is used with &lt;meta property="og:image" ...&gt; and &lt;meta property="twitter:image" ...&gt;</span>
  <span class="na">images</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">logo_outlined_6.png"</span><span class="pi">]</span>

  <span class="c1"># ...</span>

  <span class="c1"># Logo and name shown on top left of site</span>
  <span class="na">label</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">text</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Jesse</span><span class="nv"> </span><span class="s">Wei"</span>
    <span class="na">icon</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/logo_filled_outlined_6.png</span>
    <span class="na">iconHeight</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">35</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s pretty self-explanatory. I do want to show an example of how the website looks when posted in Discord.</p>

<h3 id="shortcodes">Shortcodes</h3>

<p>I want to mention <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>. There are times when you need raw HTML (e.g., figure with centered caption, YouTube video embed, etc.), and shortcodes are shortcodes for doing so. Quite a few are <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes">built in to Hugo</a> and PaperMod, and they’re very convenient.</p>

<p>Shortcodes are not built-in to al-folio, to my knowledge, however. In al-folio, the convention is just to inline the raw HTML, so that’s what I’ll be doing to replicate the result of the shortcodes (see my old PaperMod site for the actual results). If you inspect the source code, then you’ll see how convenient shortcodes are!</p>

<h3 id="deploy">Deploy</h3>

<p>Resource 2 describes how to deploy a Hugo site to Netlify. Here’s a <a href="https://youtu.be/hjD9jTi_DQ4?t=2230">timestamp</a> for that portion of the video.</p>

<p>The build process is incredibly simple. In the video, the only command you input for the build process is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo</code>.</p>

<p>My build process involves slightly more than just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo</code> since I also have to build PaperMod_diff <sup id="fnref:10:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>. So, I use <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/scripts/netlify">scripts/netlify</a>. My build command in Site settings &gt; Build &amp; deploy &gt; Build command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod +x scripts/netlify;./scripts/netlify</code>.</p>

<p>You can ignore that unless you also want to set up a PaperMod_diff page.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>al-folio deployment is easier because it already includes a GH action for deploying to GH pages. You just need to name your repo {your GH username}.github.io and follow some other steps in the README.</p>

<p>However, deploying the site locally on an M1 MacBook was a huge pain in the ass. For some reason, deploying via Docker wasn’t working, which is super weird. Then Ruby and Jekyll installation was not straightforward. I eventually got local deployment to work after following this YouTube video.</p>

<h2 id="my-website">My website</h2>

<p>Now I’ll describe specific features of my website.</p>

<h3 id="configyml-1">config.yml</h3>

<p>The latest version of my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> is <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/config.yml">here</a>.</p>

<p>I think I use reasonable values, and I use comments to explain decisions I consider non-obvious. I’ll explain some specific decisions I made in this file in the below sections as they come up.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-1">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>I was very confused by the meanings of several parameters in PaperMod’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> and had to read PaperMod’s documentation about several parameters. Plus, there are some super weird things that I had to modify. For example, my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/teaching</code> page had the page title <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Teachings</code> even though the URL was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"teaching"</code>, which was super confusing. After Googling, it turns out I had to set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pluralizeListTitles</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>, but this parameter doesn’t even exist in PaperMod’s base <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>? In addition, this is obviously a feature that should be off by default, so I’m not sure why it’s enabled by default.</p>

<p>al-folio’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> is commented super well, and I had no issues.</p>

<h3 id="papermod-diff">PaperMod diff</h3>

<p>I created PaperMod diff <sup id="fnref:10:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> using the scripts in <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/tree/main/scripts">scripts/</a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff.py</code> runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> between corresponding files, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers/generate_directory_index_caddystyle.py</code> creates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> files recursively, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> wraps <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff.py</code> to deploy its output to Netlify (see <a href="#deploy">Deploy</a>). <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">helpers/cd.py</code> is also used.</p>

<p>Do note that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content/posts/papermod_diff</code> is <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/blob/main/.gitignore">gitignored</a>. This is because if it weren’t, then the content there would change and be shown on GitHub every time I modify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code>, which is redundant and would make the commit history harder to read. My solution (gitignore the folder and generate it during the build process in Netlify) is a bit roundabout, but it’s already implemented and works well.</p>

<h3 id="content-1">Content</h3>

<p>This section is a continuation of <a href="#specifying-layout-of-a-page">Specifying layout of a page</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s look more closely at the structure of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content/teaching</code>, which is a list layout.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>content/teaching
├── act               List layout within list layout
│   ├── _index.md     Note, _index.md, not index.md!
│   ├── binary
│   ├── desmos
│   ├── eulers_formula
│   ├── ...
├── comp110

│   └── index.md
├── comp210
│   ├── img
│   └── index.md
└── comp311
    ├── img
    ├── index.md
    └── review
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My <a href="https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/">Teaching</a> page has a list layout because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">teaching/</code> doesn’t have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comp110/</code> directory is a single because it has an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>. It’s accessible by <a href="https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/comp110">/teaching/comp110</a>. It also contains an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img/</code> directory that’s accessible from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.md</code>. The images could go in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/static/</code>, but I prefer bundling them with the page.</p>

<p>It’s possible to have a list layout within a list layout, and <a href="https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/teaching/act">/teaching/act</a> is an example. However, notice <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">act/</code> must have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_index.md</code> file (note the underscore) since it’s a non-leaf.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/">Page Bundles</a> for more details.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-2">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>Honestly, this was (and still is) a bit confusing to me. I can see how it is more organized, but I don’t see why it’s necessary.</p>

<p>al-folio’s directory structure feels just like that of a raw HTML and CSS website and was much easier to get used to.</p>

<h3 id="latex">\(\LaTeX{}\)</h3>

<p>I enabled \(\LaTeX{}\) via <a href="https://katex.org/">KaTeX</a> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/extend_head.html</code>.</p>

<p>I followed <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/math-typesetting/">Math Typesetting</a> from PaperMod documentation. Specifically, the code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">extend_head.html</code> is mostly from <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/issues/236#issuecomment-778936434">Issue #236</a>.</p>

<p>I modified the condition for loading the KaTeX script. The site param <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> must be true. Then KaTeX will be loaded by default in all pages. Setting the local param <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> in front matter will cause that page to not load KaTeX.</p>

<p>I think having to opt-in is super annoying, so I’d rather enable it globally and be able to opt-out.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-3">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>al-folio uses MathJax by default. As shown <a href="http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php">here</a>, MathJax is on par or faster than KaTeX. In my experience, MathJax is also less restrictive.</p>

<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>

<p>I enabled comments using <a href="https://giscus.app">giscus</a>.</p>

<p>I followed the directions on the giscus site to install giscus in my repo and pasted code from the giscus website into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/comments.html</code>. I also added <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comments: true</code> to config.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are comments at the bottom of almost every page. PaperMod automatically disables comments in the index profile, search, and archives layouts. I manually disabled comments in my <a href="https://cheerful-mousse-b9d87b.netlify.app/privacy/">Privacy policy</a> page in the front matter with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">comments: false</code>.</p>

<p>Comments show up in <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a>. Make sure to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository#">enable Discussions</a> in your GitHub repo.</p>

<p>However, the comment box does not automatically change color on theme toggle if all you do is add the script. I found an implementation online for it, and it’s in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/comments.html</code>.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-4">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>al-folio implements giscus (and Disqus, deprecated) by default. The only change needed is some configuration in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>. In addition, the comment box automatically toggles color when the theme is toggled.</p>

<h3 id="social-icons-in-footer">Social icons in footer</h3>

<p>I added social icons to the footer, as in resource <sup id="fnref:4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. I sort of follow what it describes but make some of my own adjustments.</p>

<p>As described there, adding social icons to footer messes with CSS spacing values. For example, a scrollbar appeared on the homepage and Search page (haven’t solved this and don’t plan to) even though there’s enough room for both header and footer to be visible without scrolling. This issue is described more in-depth in resource <sup id="fnref:4:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, under problem 2.</p>

<p>In short, I modified CSS in 4 files. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/footer.html</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/social_icons.html</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/css/core/theme-vars.css</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/css/common/profile-mode.css</code>. The comments in each file describe the changes I made. Most comments in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">social_icons.html</code> are for htmltest, described <a href="#ci">below</a>, so ignore those for now.</p>

<p>I disabled footer social icons on the homepage because the homepage already has social icons.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-5">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>I didn’t bother with this since al-folio puts social icons in the footer of the homepage by default. That’s fine with me.</p>

<h3 id="other-footer-changes">Other footer changes</h3>

<p>Beyond that, I made some other minor changes to the footer.</p>

<p>I added the separator character • between phrases in the footer.</p>

<p>The links were originally like this:</p>

<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Powered by
<span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://gohugo.io/"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"noopener noreferrer"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>Hugo<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span> <span class="err">&amp;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">"https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/"</span> <span class="na">rel=</span><span class="s">"noopener"</span> <span class="na">target=</span><span class="s">"_blank"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>PaperMod<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I removed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target=_blank</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rel="noopener noreferrer"</code> because <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G200.html">links should not usually open new tabs</a>.</p>

<p>I added a privacy policy page and a link to it in the footer.</p>

<p>Lastly, I removed “Powered by Hugo and PaperMod” in the homepage specifically to keep it minimal.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-6">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>It’s much easier to change the text of the al-folio footer because you need only edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>However, it seems that all external links open in new tabs in al-folio. Personally, I don’t like that, but I get that the purpose is to get the user to stay on your site. It’s fine with me since the behavior is consistent, but I might end up changing this.</p>

<h3 id="single-1">Single</h3>

<p>I slightly modified <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/_default/single.html</code>. I moved the ToC above the cover. Notice on this page that the ToC is above the cover image.</p>

<h3 id="links-are-carolina-blue-on-hover">Links are Carolina blue on hover</h3>

<p>This was just basic CSS.</p>

<p>I modified CSS in the following CSS files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/css/common/</code>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">footer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post-entry</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post-single</code>.</p>

<p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.css</code> has these important lines:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">/* Change color on hover */</span>
<span class="nt">a</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--carolina_blue</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">a</span><span class="nc">.anchor</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--carolina_blue</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nt">svg</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nl">color</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">var</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">--carolina_blue</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For modifications, look for comments and the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">carolina_blue</code>. Check PaperMod diff.</p>

<p>Since I made links blue on hover, I removed underline on hover (the link is still underlined if it had an underline before hovering though).</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-7">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>al-folio colors links and underlines on hover by default. All I did was change the theme colors to UNC blue in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_sass/_variables.scss</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_sass/_themes.scss</code>.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-highlighting-via-chroma">Syntax highlighting via Chroma</h3>

<p>I disabled <a href="https://highlightjs.org">highlight.js</a> (default) and enabled Hugo Chroma following the <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-faq/#using-hugos-syntax-highlighter-chroma">steps in PaperMod documentation</a>. This required a few changes in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/css/extended/*.css</code>.</p>

<p>I disabled line numbers by default in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">config.yml</code> for readability. Most code blocks you’ve seen so far have not had line numbers.</p>

<p>However, you can enable line numbers for a specific code block, as shown in the <a href="#baseof">baseof</a> code block, by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{lineNos=true}</code> to the code block. <sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>It was very easy to install just one Chroma theme. However, I also wanted the code theme to toggle when the theme toggles. This should’ve been decently easy because all I had to do was a second stylesheet with a dark code theme and add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.dark</code> to the class names. However, I ran into a lot of issues with the light theme CSS overriding the dark theme CSS for most combinations of themes. It could’ve been a fault in my implementation, but without changing anything, the specific combination of pygments (light) and dracula (dark) didn’t have any issues, so I’m not sure what was going on.</p>

<p>Plus, there’s a second issue. Line numbers on code blocks look weird.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-8">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>Everything works well by default! I changed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$code-bg-color-light</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sass/_variables.scss</code>, but I think that’s it.</p>

<p>However, Hugo’s code syntax highlighter supports <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go-html-template</code> (I just specify <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">text</code> in this post) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arduino</code>, whereas Jekyll’s doesn’t. In addition, in PaperMod, I didn’t have to convert double braces to single braces inside code blocks like I had to do in this post.</p>

<h3 id="table-of-contents">Table of Contents</h3>

<p>This one is quite important to me but is horrible to implement on PaperMod.</p>

<p>On this post, notice the ToC on the side (if your screen is wide enough) that automatically changes color to show you where you are in the post. In addition, since there’s not enough room to show all the headings, it only shows all the top-level headings and expands the lower-level headings of the heading you’re currently on. I think this is a very good feature for organization too since you don’t get much out of seeing lower-level headings if you’re not reading that section.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://reorx.github.io/hugo-PaperModX/docs/papermodx-new-features/">fork</a> of PaperMod called PaperModX that roughly implements this. However, it is not a good implementation, and that’s the best implementation I found (compared to two others in a PaperMod PR and a PaperMod issue). That implementation will show all headings and will display a scrollbar (such as on this page in my PaperMod website) if there are too many headings. It does highlight the active heading, but if there’s a scrollbar, then it won’t scroll down when you get to the bottom, and the active element feature will then break completely. <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/25">GH issue with more information</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re somehow still interested in implementing this feature in PaperMod, then the relevant code is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets/css/common/post-single.css</code> (for putting the ToC on the side and hiding it on small screens), <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/footer.html</code> (for a short script - I’m not sure what it does), and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/toc.html</code> (adds a few classes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toc</code> div and the script for scrolling and keeping track of the active ToC element). Check PaperMod diff <sup id="fnref:10:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-9">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>The Bootstrap ToC plugin just works! See the <a href="https://alshedivat.github.io/al-folio/blog/2023/sidebar-table-of-contents/">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>The only thing I would change is that on small screens, the side ToC (if enabled) disappears, and there’s nothing to replace it. In the implementation described above, if there’s not a side ToC, then the ToC is at the top of the post (as in normal PaperMod).</p>

<p>I did check what happens with the Bootstrap ToC when there are enough headings to fill the screen by resizing my window. There is no scrollbar, and the ToC just overflows the screen and is cut off. However, realistically speaking, this should never occur, and even if it does, the top-level headings will still be shown.</p>

<h3 id="hamburgerresponsive-menu">Hamburger/responsive menu</h3>

<p>There should be a hamburger menu for small screens. Several people asked for an implementation of this, but Aditya refuses to merge the change. What’s funny is he implemented it himself and sent the relevant code in Discord but chooses not to merge it into the repo…?</p>

<p>Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/commit/9d74c542e64699557cda562edacacccc700cd3c8">commit</a> where I copied in the code, and here’s the relevant <a href="https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/discussions/943">issue</a>.</p>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-10">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>You’ll never guess…</p>

<p>al-folio supports this by default. In addition, al-folio also supports dropdown menus and allows you to choose between sticky and fixed header and footer.</p>

<h3 id="miscellaneous-bugs-and-shortcomings">Miscellaneous bugs and shortcomings</h3>

<h4 id="papermod">PaperMod</h4>

<p>The scrollbar is bugged on Safari. <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/22">More information and a fix</a>. This is a problem with the original theme.</p>

<p>Link underlines either disappear or turn the wrong color on theme toggle. <a href="https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev-PaperMod/issues/23">More information</a>, and I have not found a solution for this. This is a problem on PaperMod’s site too.</p>

<p>This isn’t really a bug, but in PaperMod, if you use a footnote more than once, then the footnote at the bottom of the post will just specify ↩ ↩ ↩ …, one arrow for each footnote reference. However, al-folio specifies ↩ ↩2 ↩3 …</p>

<h4 id="al-folio">al-folio</h4>

<p>Have found only one bug! So far… 🤞</p>

<p>On the sidebar ToC, at least with a sticky navbar, if you click a heading, then the page will scroll such that the heading is at the top of the page, and the navbar above that. However, the active ToC element probably won’t be the heading you clicked on because the sticky navbar above takes up some space, so the script thinks the active element is the heading above the one you clicked on.</p>

<p>This isn’t a bug, but I would like it if the side ToC ignores the automatically-generated heading “Enjoy Reading This Article?”</p>

<h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>

<p>For Google Analytics, just add your Google Analytics tag to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">googleAnalytics</code> in the config. For example, mine has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">googleAnalytics: G-Q603T56FWT</code>.</p>

<p>PaperMod automatically uses the Google Analytics script if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">env</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">production</code> (default). See the bottom of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/head.html</code>:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{- /* Misc */}
{- if hugo.IsProduction | or (eq site.Params.env "production") }
{- template "_internal/google_analytics.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/opengraph.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/twitter_cards.html" . }
{- template "partials/templates/schema_json.html" . }
{- end -}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="al-folio-comparison-11">al-folio comparison</h4>

<p>al-folio also has Google Analytics by default.</p>

<h3 id="ci">CI</h3>

<p>I added a GH workflow for checking links in my site and spellcheck. This is not directly related to PaperMod and al-folio.</p>

  </picture>

</figure>

    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">htmltest GH Action output</div>

<p>See <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github/workflows/ci.yml</code> and its configuration file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.github/.htmltest.yml</code>. This follows resource <sup id="fnref:5:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, with some modifications. In particular, I want to note that I run my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scripts/build</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ci.yml</code> instead of just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hugo</code>, as in the original file.</p>

<h4 id="behavior">Behavior</h4>

<p>Here is the intended behavior of the htmltest job after making the modifications below.</p>

<p>If an internal link (e.g., a page or image) doesn’t work, the workflow will fail, causing a red X to appear on GH Actions.</p>

<p>If an external link doesn’t work, htmltest will warn, but the workflow will not fail. That is, an external link could be “broken,” and a green checkmark will be shown on GH Actions. This is fine because when using a lot of external links, it’s unlikely that all will work in any single run. There could be a timeout or non-200 HTML response code, etc.. Getting a red X when just a single external link breaks is annoying. htmltest does still warn, so I manually check GH actions every now and then.</p>

<h4 id="getting-rid-of-garbage-output">Getting rid of garbage output</h4>

<p>There was originally &gt;100 lines of garbage output. htmltest complained that the site logo’s link at the top left had no alt text, and my LinkedIn link in social icons in the footer returned non-OK exit status 999. Since the header and footer are in all pages, this caused a lot of errors, which made the output unreadable.</p>

<p>I fixed this in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/header.html</code> by adding non-empty alt text to the logo and in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/partials/social_icons.html</code> by excluding the LinkedIn link from htmltest using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-proofer-ignore</code> attribute, as specified in <a href="https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest#see_no_evil-ignoring-content">htmltest’s README</a>.</p>

<p>The top 3 links are ones I want to keep even though they don’t actually work. So I manually ignored them in the post (not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">layouts/</code>) using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data-proofer-ignore</code> attribute in rawhtml. <sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>And the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#center</code> thing is how you can <a href="https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/posts/papermod/papermod-faq/#centering-image-in-markdown">center an image in Markdown syntax in PaperMod</a>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#center</code> also gets appended to an image URL if you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">align="center"</code> in figure shortcode. But since this causes htmltest to freak out, I added this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.htmltest.yml</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">IgnoreURLs</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="c1"># Ignore &lt;img src="*#center"&gt; for centered images in PaperMod, which would cause "hash not found"</span>
  <span class="c1"># This is suboptimal because we ideally want to check the image URL without the #center suffix</span>

  <span class="c1"># Match internal image path ending in #center</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">.*\.(apng|gif|ico|cur|jpg|jpeg|jfif|pjpeg|pjp|png|svg)#center$$</span>
  <span class="c1"># Match external image URL ending in #center</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">(https://|http://|www\.).*\.[A-Za-z]+#center$$</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can tell by the comments, this is suboptimal and can lead to false negatives. I can think of two solutions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify htmltest to ignore specific hashes but check the rest of the URL <sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></li>
  <li>Modify PaperMod to center the image without appending <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#center</code></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="make-gh-actions-display-red-x-on-failure">Make GH Actions display red X on failure</h4>

<p>Instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue-on-error: true</code> from resource <sup id="fnref:5:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, I use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if: always()</code>.</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Test HTML</span>
  <span class="c1"># https://github.com/wjdp/htmltest-action/</span>
  <span class="na">uses</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">wjdp/htmltest-action@master</span>
  <span class="na">with</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="na">config</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">./.github/.htmltest.yml</span>
<span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Archive htmltest results</span>
  <span class="c1"># Archive result even if Test HTML fails</span>
  <span class="c1"># Use if: always() instead of continue-on-error, as in the original file</span>
  <span class="c1"># Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62045967/github-actions-is-there-a-way-to-continue-on-error-while-still-getting-correct</span>
  <span class="na">if</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">always()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if: always()</code> will cause logging to occur even if Test HTML fails. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue-on-error: true</code> does the same. However, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">continue-on-error: true</code> would cause GH Actions to display a green checkmark when Test HTML fails, which is misleading.</p>

<h4 id="ignoreexternalbrokenlinks">IgnoreExternalBrokenLinks</h4>

<p>I added this to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.htmltest.yml</code>:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1"># This does not "ignore" the broken links, but it does not fail the action</span>
<span class="c1"># From the htmltest README:</span>
<span class="c1"># When true produces a warning, rather than an error, for broken external links.</span>
<span class="na">IgnoreExternalBrokenLinks</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With a lot of external links, it’s unlikely that all external links will work during any one run. Maybe there’ll be a timeout or bad HTML response code, etc.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are definitely some other modifications I made to PaperMod that I didn’t describe here, but these are the major points.</p>

<p>I think this post pretty much confirms 100% that, at the moment, Jekyll + al-folio is better than Hugo + PaperMod. Looking into the future, however, Hugo is growing a lot faster than Jekyll is (and imho, it overall does feel better than Jekyll). I can’t be sure if I made an optimal long-term choice, but al-folio is really dang good, and I don’t think I’ll have to completely refactor my website again any time soon.</p>

<p>If you’re using PaperMod, then I hope this post makes it easy for you add some of the necessary features. However, whether you’re using PaperMod or deciding whether to use it or anything else, I hope you consider al-folio!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>My relevant credentials: I studied for the ACT using only free resources and scored a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6aFuEPKvbsZlgWtR2-lMSE_7sr83XcS/view?usp=sharing">36</a> on my first try. I also privately tutored for a while, and you can see my <a href="/blog/category/act">blog</a> for the ACT-related stuff I’ve written. I don’t tutor anymore, and I’m not trying to sell you anything - this guide is purely to help you get the score you want fast and without needing to spend any money.</p>

<p>You might’ve heard of tutors and textbooks that cost a small fortune, but you can study as effectively as possible without spending any money. The best ACT resources are available online for free.</p>

<p>The most important part of this guide is <a href="#resources">Resources</a>, specifically the subpart <a href="#official-tests">Official tests</a>. My #1 piece of advice throughout the years has been that you must use <strong>official (previously administered) tests</strong> to prep, and don’t waste your time on crap (third-party) practice questions. If that’s the only thing you take away from this guide, you’ll have gained ~51% of what it has to offer.</p>

<p>Due to a copyright claim from ACT, Inc., examples in this guide involving copyrighted ACT content have been removed or replaced. Specifically, I had to take down a link to a Google Drive containing previously administered tests from the past two decades. However, I cannot stress enough that you must use official ACT tests to prep.</p>

<h2 id="study-plan">Study plan</h2>

<p>This section describes the high-level study plan you should follow. More specific tips are provided later.</p>

<h3 id="test-format">Test format</h3>

<p>You should first familiarize yourself with the test format.</p>

<p>Read <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-format-expert-guide">PrepScholar - ACT Format: Expert Guide</a> for a quick breakdown.</p>

<p>Since the ACT has such strict time constraints, it’s important to know the number of questions per section, time per section, and time per question.</p>

<h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

<p>English and Math are <strong>content-oriented</strong>. This means each question is created to cover specific grammar/math topic(s) that you should’ve learned in school. If you don’t understand the topic(s) that an English/Math question is testing, then you’d have to guess.</p>

<p>Reading and Science are <strong>skill-oriented</strong>. Certainly Reading can’t test you on content of specific books, and Science rarely tests any actual science knowledge (i.e., usually 1 or 2 questions out of 40). These sections do not test “topics.” Instead, they test your ability to absorb new content and answer questions about it quickly. Another way to put it: all answers to all Reading and <em>most</em> Science questions are in the passages and figures.</p>

<p>Reading tests you with fiction, social studies, humanities, and natural science passages, and Science tests you with scientific passages and figures (graphs, tables, charts, etc.). On the surface, Reading and Science might seem quite different, but the skills they test are actually quite similar.</p>

<h3 id="study-strategy">Study strategy</h3>

<p>Based on the above, there are fundamental differences between how you should prep for English and Math compared to Reading and Science.</p>

<h4 id="english-and-math">English and Math</h4>

<p>For English and Math, you have to understand the basic concepts before grinding out practice tests. If there’s a basic concept you don’t understand, you need to learn it. Doing a bunch of circle problems won’t be of much use if you don’t understand circle concepts: circumference, area, circle equation, etc.</p>

<p>To figure out which English and Math concepts you don’t understand, you should take one or two practice tests. Write down what you missed, and figure out the specific topics you need to learn. If you missed question 3, is it because you didn’t understand the topic(s) it was testing? If so, which topic(s)?</p>

<p>I want to note that it can be hard to figure out which topic is tested if you don’t already know the topic. You don’t know what you don’t know. In that case, Googling the question is often helpful, and if that doesn’t work, you should ask someone. See <a href="#act-communities">ACT communities</a> for links to the ACT Discord server and ACT subreddit.</p>

<p>Then you should learn these concepts. <a href="#textbooks-and-websites">Resources</a> are provided below.</p>

<p>Once you’ve learned all or nearly all of the basic concepts, you should have at least a 30. This is only a heuristic. It’s up to you whether you think you have a solid understanding of the basic concepts, and if you already do, then you should move on to the next step.</p>

<p>Once you understand the basic concepts, the rest of the points will come from grinding out practice tests to improve at taking the ACT (general test-taking skills, learning patterns in the questions, etc.). That is, your focus should no longer be on learning new content, though if you come across something you don’t know (which shouldn’t happen often at this stage), you should obviously learn it. Your focus at this point should be your test-taking skills: answering questions faster, not making careless mistakes, etc. If you know the concept but still got the question wrong, then why did that happen, and how can you fix it?</p>

<h4 id="reading-and-science">Reading and Science</h4>

<p>For Reading and Science, you should read about some high-level strategies that work for other people and figure out what you think would work well for you. <a href="#textbooks-and-websites">Resources</a> that describe strategies and walk through questions are provided below. Then practice and refine those strategies by grinding out practice tests. You should focus on and work on improving your test-taking skills (reading speed, comprehension, etc.) at this time.</p>

<h4 id="the-differences">The differences</h4>

<p>Notice the differences above. For English and Math, if you don’t already have a solid understanding of the basic concepts, then you should spend a lot of time learning those concepts before grinding out practice tests.</p>

<p>For Reading and Science, however, it should take only a small amount of time to introduce yourself to some high-level tips and strategies. Then you should immediately start grinding out practice tests to practice with those strategies.</p>

<p>In either case, once you have a solid grasp of the basics (for English and Math, grammar and math concepts; for Reading and Science, general strategies for the sections), you should grind out practice tests with the goal of improving your general test-taking skills.</p>

<p>As mentioned in <a href="#basics">Basics</a>, Reading and Science don’t really test specific topics since they’re <strong>skill-oriented</strong>, so I mostly omit those rows in the table above. Reading tests your reading comprehension under time pressure, and I consider Science to be Reading part 2, except with data and figures: graphs, charts, tables, etc. It tests reading and data comprehension in the context of scientific passages and figures.</p>

<p>Each Science section does have 1-3 questions that require actual science knowledge that you should have learned from high school science classes. For a review, see the resource in the table above.</p>

<h2 id="advice-for-learning-concepts">Advice for learning concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you have questions, you should ask in the ACT Discord server or ACT subreddit (see <a href="#act-communities">ACT communities</a>). There are plenty of smart people there who are willing to help. You might also consider a private tutor.</li>
  <li>If you can tell that you’re seriously struggling with some topic, then you should learn that topic from scratch. Choose good resource(s), and read everything about that topic. Otherwise, if you have a good baseline of knowledge, you might want to skim to selectively fill in the gaps. In general, be smart about how you study.</li>
  <li>Keep track of your strengths and weaknesses. You should spend more time on your weaknesses than on your strengths, of course.</li>
  <li>How much time you should spend on studying a particular topic should depend on how often it appears on the exam and how well you understand that topic already.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="advice-for-practice-tests">Advice for practice tests</h2>

<p>Once you have a firm grasp on the basic concepts of English and Math and have some solid strategies for Reading and Science, you should start grinding out practice tests. This is to help you learn the patterns in the test so you can subconsciously “game” the test. You should also identify trends in the mistakes you make to figure out how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>, you must use official tests to prep. By official, I mean authentic (i.e., previously administered - past students got their actual scores from these tests) tests from ACT, Inc. Do not use third-party tests. You can find more information in <a href="#official-tests">Official tests</a>.</p>

<p>When taking practice tests, you should replicate actual testing conditions. This means that you should set timers during the test and take the whole test at once instead of just taking individual sections. At the start, you can take untimed tests and individual sections to get acclimated, but you should eventually transition to timed full tests.</p>

<p>Reviewing your mistakes is critical to improving. Specifically, for each question you answered incorrectly or struggled with, ask yourself 3 questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What mistake did I make?</li>
  <li>Why did I make this mistake?</li>
  <li>How do I prevent myself from making this mistake again?</li>
</ol>

<p>You should write down your answers to these 3 questions so that you can find trends in your mistakes. Here’s an example of the answers I gave to the 3 questions for a Math question I missed (specifically, Form A11 June 2018 Math #58):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Careless mistake</li>
  <li>I knew 2+5 and 3+4 but forgot to factor in 5+2 and 4+3.</li>
  <li>If my answer isn’t an answer choice, I must’ve done something wrong, so check my work and look for the mistake.</li>
</ol>

<p>Answer these questions thoroughly. For example, don’t simply brush off a careless mistake. Instead, figure out why you made that careless mistake. Did you misread? Were you in a hurry because you were running out of time (maybe spent too long on other questions)? Did you think you were done with the question but forgot a detail?</p>

<p>Figure out why you made that mistake, and then figure out how to prevent it. If you brush it off without trying to figure out why you made that mistake, then you’ll probably make the same mistake again.</p>

<p>Sometimes, a careless mistake is truly just unlucky. Regardless, try to find a specific reason for every careless mistake you make.</p>

<p>If you do this enough, you should be able to find trends in the mistakes you make. One reader of my guide actually sent me a screenshot of an Excel spreadsheet he used to track mistakes. If you’re able to notice trends, that’s great, and you should use trends to inform your test-taking strategies.</p>

<h2 id="specific-tips">Specific tips</h2>

<p>This section contains specific tips for each section of the ACT. Since I personally used many of the ACT textbooks in <a href="#textbooks-and-websites">Resources</a>, this section consists of the high points of those textbooks (though I suggest that you read them for more tips) and my own tips that I learned from experience.</p>

<p>The strategies I describe are ones that worked for me and my students. Although I believe they’re optimal, there may be better strategies for you.</p>

<h3 id="general">General</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Here’s one of the big secrets you should know (and there aren’t many): <strong>There are no hard questions</strong>. A standardized test, by definition, is a test created based on standards that are the same for everyone in the U.S. For example, the ACT can’t test calculus or advanced statistics on the math section because not everyone has access to calculus and advanced statistics courses. The math section is limited to concepts everyone should have learned in high school. As such, there are no hard problems that you are incapable of figuring out as long as you understand the <a href="#basics">basic concepts</a>. It’s important to keep in mind that you can always solve any Reading or Science question, and same for English and Math as long as you understand the basic concept(s) that question is testing.
    <ul>
      <li>One way the ACT imposes difficulty is by imposing strict time limits. Even if you understand all of the basic concepts so that you could solve every question, perhaps you haven’t practiced enough to be able to solve every question quickly.</li>
      <li>Additionally, the ACT tests basic knowledge, such as precalculus and below for math, in ways you may not be familiar with. I show an example of this in the <a href="#math">math section below</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Here’s another big secret: Every question and correct answer must be <em>*bulletproof</em>. This means that there must always be one unambiguously correct answer to every question. If there were more than one correct answer or even no correct answer, students would complain to the ACT about their scores, and that’s something that ACT, Inc. doesn’t want to deal with.
    <ul>
      <li>How can you apply this knowledge? Well, now you know that no matter how much the ACT questions use terms like “most likely” and “best answer,” there is only one correct answer, and all other choices are wrong. If you’re having trouble finding the right answer, look for the hole(s) in the incorrect answers; it’s guaranteed that there are hole(s) in every incorrect answer and no holes in the correct answer.</li>
      <li>And don’t think like this either: “Well, this answer choice seems alright, but this other answer choice also seems ok.” That’s the wrong way to go about it. One of those is 100% right (assuming that you haven’t eliminated the right answer choice), and the other one is 100% wrong. This is a black-and-white test.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>One last secret: For all sections (yes, even and especially in ACT Math), you need to <strong>read very precisely</strong>. In all sections, there are questions that include words or short phrases that you must consider to answer the question correctly. These important phrases can also be found in the passages. You must learn to read fast enough to meet the strict time constraints but also precisely enough that you don’t glance over important details.</li>
  <li>If you notice that you’re spending too much time on a single question, skip it because all questions are worth the same, regardless of difficulty. I usually work through about 90% of the questions on my first pass and then answer the rest on my second pass.</li>
  <li>Bubble your answers efficiently. Efficient bubbling could save up to 2 minutes, roughly, and since you’re allowed only 35 minutes for both ACT Reading and ACT Science, that time is incredibly valuable. Doing a question in the test booklet and then bubbling in the answer immediately afterward wastes a lot of time because it requires that you physically move your hand over to the answer form and mentally switch tasks for every question. I find it much more efficient to complete an entire section and bubble all of my answers for that section in at the end of my first pass. Then, I’ll do the unfinished questions during my second pass and bubble those in.
    <ul>
      <li>Of course, you could end up misbubbling, which could make you misbubble all succeeding answers as well. I prevent this by mentally telling myself, “1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C…”</li>
      <li>I bubbled like this for 8 practice tests and misbubbled only once (for a single question).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Process of elimination is obviously very useful. On most questions, there are one or two blatantly incorrect answers. On hard questions in which you have trouble deciding on the correct answer, eliminate those first.</li>
  <li>Lastly, consider underlining keywords in questions. I find that while I’m working on a question, it’s easy to forget a detail in the question, which can lead to an incorrect answer. Underlining keywords can help you avoid this.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="english">English</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If you are not satisfied with your English score, you’re in luck! The general consensus is that ACT English is the easiest section to improve in because it is mostly just grammar rules.</li>
  <li>ACT English is heavily based on grammar rules. Learn all the grammar rules tested by the ACT, and ingrain them into your memory by applying those grammar rules in your daily life, your writing, and in your English classes. You can also improve your grammar by reading formal books and articles that use proper grammar.</li>
  <li>Conciseness is key. For questions that test conciseness (e.g., questions for which every answer choice is grammatically correct, and the only difference is conciseness), choose the shortest answer choice.</li>
  <li>Avoid redundancy. If the answer choice repeats something that was previously stated, it is incorrect.</li>
  <li>Take context into account. For many questions, the correct answer is decided not only by the sentence the underlined phrase is in, but also the preceding or succeeding sentence.
    <ul>
      <li>Specifically, For questions about transitions between paragraphs, read the first few lines of the paragraph that the transition is in and the last few lines of the preceding paragraph.</li>
      <li>For questions involving transitions in or between sentences, figure out the relationship between the two parts on either side of the transition, and choose the answer choice that exemplifies that relationship.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure you understand the meanings of transition words. You can use <a href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/">Transitional Words and Phrases</a> to learn them.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="math">Math</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I previously mentioned that there are no hard questions on the ACT, and “hard” questions are really just questions involving basic concepts that are tested weirdly. For example, consider this question:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When \((x+y)^8\) is expanded, what is the coefficient of the \(x^4y^4\) term?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The obvious brute force approach involving multiplying out \(\underbrace{(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\dots (x+y)}_{8}\) takes too much time and would siphon time from other questions.</p>

<p>The trick here is to see the question from a combinatorial viewpoint.</p>

<p>Any \(x^4y^4\) term that appears in the polynomial expansion comes from choosing 4 of the 8 binomials to contribute an \(x\), fixing the other 4 to contribute a \(y\) (or vice versa).</p>

<p>The number of ways for this to occur is equal to \(\binom{8}{4}\), the number of ways to choose an unordered group of 4 from 8.</p>

<p>Thus, this problem reduces to computing \(\binom{8}{4}=\frac{8!}{4!4!}=70\).</p>

<p>More details in my article about <a href="/blog/2022/pascals-triangle/">Pascal’s triangle</a>.</p>

<p>If this explanation doesn’t quite click, that’s okay. Maybe your understanding of combinatorics is a bit shaky - combinatorics generally isn’t covered well in high school. What matters is that you see that this is not an unsolvable hard question. It’s just one that has a “trick.” This applies to all “hard” questions on the ACT. As an aside, this also applies in general to math in school, in my experience, having gone through high school and college (undergraduate) math. See the article <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/blog/articles/learn-problem-solving-approach-to-mathematics">Why It’s So Important To Learn A Problem-Solving Approach To Mathematics</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For “hard” questions like the previous, of which there are relatively few, you need only notice one or two small details and then apply basic concept(s). There will never be a question that uses an advanced concept that was never covered in high school.</li>
  <li>If your answer is not an answer choice, that means you did something wrong, so you need to check your work and look for the mistake.</li>
  <li>There are plenty of math questions in which a single small but important detail in the question completely changes the answer. You should <ins>underline</ins> those small details so that you don’t forget about them while you’re solving the problem.</li>
  <li>Don’t spend too much time on easy questions (questions 1-39). Most of the time, they really are just that easy, and there is no trick. If you take too long on the easy ones, you won’t have enough time for the hard ones.</li>
  <li>You need to use fast solutions to problems. If you miss a question because you ran out of time, then you could’ve gotten it right if you did the previous questions faster. While reviewing a question you took too long to solve, first try finding a fast solution by yourself. If you can’t, try Googling the question or asking someone (<a href="#act-communities">ACT communities</a>).</li>
  <li>For some questions, it is faster to plug in answer choices instead of solving for the correct answer. Although, the brute force approach is also slower for other questions. You need to develop an intuition for when to do so, which you can accomplish by doing lots of practice problems.</li>
  <li>Similarly, while checking over your work, you can often plug in your answer to verify its correctness.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>

<p>The strategy that works for most people is skimming the passage, reading the questions, and then looking for answers in the passage.</p>

<p>While skimming, you should not read overly carefully. Your goals should be getting a high-level understanding of the passage and creating a mental map of the information. On the other hand, you should read very carefully while looking for answers to questions.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-skim">How to skim</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Some people advise reading the questions before reading the passages. In my experience, this is a terrible strategy. It wastes a lot of time and does not help much with knowing what to look for.</li>
  <li>Don’t over-annotate. It’s okay to write 1-3 words beside some paragraphs to help you remember what they mean, but you simply do not have enough time to write detailed annotations.</li>
  <li>Since time is so limited, you need to be able to read fast.
    <ul>
      <li>Read as fast as you can without sacrificing too much comprehension.</li>
      <li>Figure out how fast you can read while still understanding the gist of the passage. You should also know the main ideas and roughly where to find specific details. If you happen to remember a lot of specific details, you might’ve read too in-depth, and you can afford to read faster.</li>
      <li>You should spend no more than 2:30 to skim a single passage. Preferably, you should read faster than that.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make a mental map of the information found in the passage.
    <ul>
      <li>This means that after reading, you should know roughly where to find certain bits of information.</li>
      <li>Some questions do not provide citations, such as “In line [x]” or “In paragraph [x],” so you’ll need to know roughly where to find certain bits of information to answer those questions fast.</li>
      <li>Don’t just hunt through the passage carelessly to look for an answer. Instead, think logically about where the information should be.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do not absorb every detail - you simply do not have enough time.
    <ul>
      <li>You can re-read the important details later if and when there are questions on that information. Most details aren’t tested in the questions, so why waste time absorbing everything?</li>
      <li>If you don’t understand a specific detail during the initial read-through, don’t waste time re-reading it until you understand it. That detail may not even be tested in the questions, so just move on.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When a question provides a citation, read that part (and maybe a few sentences before and after) very carefully.</li>
  <li>Some of the passages are dry and boring, but you need to pretend that you are genuinely interested in them. This will improve your concentration and comprehension.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="how-to-answer-the-questions">How to answer the questions</h4>

<ul>
  <li>While answering questions, on the other hand, you need to read relevant portion(s) of the passage very carefully and precisely.</li>
  <li>Specifically, take in all important information in the question and in the relevant portion(s), but don’t jump to any of your own conclusions.
    <ul>
      <li>We’re conditioned in English classes to infer and look for deeper meanings. However, inferences and interpretations are subjective, whereas the ACT is an objective test with bulletproof questions and answers. All correct answers are objective and do not require you to dig for deeper meanings.</li>
      <li>You should <strong>not</strong> use any of your knowledge outside of the text to answer questions. This will make you answer questions incorrectly. All the information that you need to answer the question correctly is in the text, and it requires no interpretation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Because all correct answers are objective and bulletproof, they are oftentimes just restatements of what’s already stated in the text.</li>
  <li>Since all correct answers are bulletproof, eliminate any answers with even a single wrong or inaccurate detail.</li>
  <li>It is a viable strategy to do questions with citations (“In paragraph 1,”  “In lines 12-34,” etc.)  first because those questions require that you go back to the passage. If you do them first, then you’ll be rereading parts of the passage, which may help you answer the other questions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="science">Science</h3>

<ul>
  <li>ACT Science is like Where’s Waldo, a game where you search for a single character in a cluttered picture.</li>
</ul>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

<ul>
  <li>Let’s compare this to an official ACT Science passage. Specifically, view an official practice test in the latest <a href="https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/Preparing-for-the-ACT.pdf">Preparing for the ACT Test booklet</a>, and scroll to the Science section.</li>
  <li>As you can see, Science passages includes lots of confusing science terms and information. Your job, however, is to ignore all the distractions and find what the question asks for.
    <ul>
      <li>Specifically, don’t worry about not understanding some of the science terms - the passage provides all the definitions you need.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The most important part of ACT Science is knowing what to look for. The questions help with this by using terms such as “In Figure 1,” “Based on study 2,” and “According to the passage,” which tell you where to locate your answer.</li>
  <li>Primary locators are what you should look at first and tell you roughly where to look for your answer. Secondary locators tell you exactly what your answer (Waldo) is.</li>

  <li>When doing the questions, you should not go back to the passage without a purpose. Use these locators to determine what your purpose is.</li>
  <li>Some people like to skip the passages and data and immediately go to the questions. This is much more viable than doing so in the Reading section since Science provides more locators than does Reading, but it’s not my personal preference. Personally, I prefer to skim the passage fast to get an idea of what’s going on, but use whatever approach works better for you.</li>
  <li>The general consensus is that the conflicting viewpoints passages are the most difficult. You may want to save those for last.</li>

<h3 id="writing">Writing</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The first thing to consider is whether you should actually take the Writing section. Please read <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/complete-list-which-colleges-require-act-writing-all-schools">PrepScholar - Which Colleges Require ACT Writing</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>I’m not going to give many tips for this section because 1. colleges don’t care much about writing since you’ll already be writing essays for your application (that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care about it at all because failing it will be counted against you), 2. I got only a 9/12 (96 percentile), which I don’t consider high enough for me to give tips to others.</li>
  <li>I want to mention that essay length is highly correlated with score, as shown in a graph from <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-does-act-essay-length-affect-your-score">PrepScholar - How Does ACT Essay Length Affect Your Score</a>. Read the article for possible explanations.</li>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a>, this section is the most important part of my guide.</p>

<h3 id="official-tests">Official tests</h3>

<p><em>Link removed due to a copyright notice from ACT, Inc.</em></p>

<p>You must use official tests to study (not third-party tests, like the ones in third-party textbooks). Official tests were made by the same people who write the test(s) you will take. Previous generations of students got their actual scores from these tests, so there does not exist better practice material.</p>

<p>In the past, I provided a link here to a Google Drive folder containing previously administered tests from the last two decades. However, due to a copyright notice from ACT, Inc., I’ve been forced to remove the link, though the Google Drive probably still exists. You can find a bunch of official practice tests in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Official-ACT-Prep-Guide-2023-2024-dp-1394196504/dp/1394196504/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">The Official ACT Prep Guide</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://discord.gg/ZbJJGRC">ACT Discord server</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ACT/">ACT subreddit</a></p>

<p>Lots of smart people provide free tutoring here. You can ask for resources and help in these places, and you’ll probably get a response within 10 minutes.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-study-math">How to study math</h3>

<p>I really dislike how math is taught in school, and I think most people learn math the wrong way. I want to share two resources about learning math that I highly recommend.</p>

<p><a href="https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/StudyMath/HowToStudyMath.aspx">How To Study Math (lamar.edu)</a></p>

<p><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/blog/articles/learn-problem-solving-approach-to-mathematics">Why It’s So Important To Learn A Problem-Solving Approach To Mathematics</a></p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>

<details>
<summary>What did you study, and how long did you study every day?</summary>
<p>I studied for the entire month before my test. During the first few days, I completed a diagnostic practice test and created a couple of pages in OneNote to keep track of the scores I got and mistakes I made. My initial practice test score was a composite 33 (35E 35M 30R 33S, if I remember correctly). After that, I spent about 30% of the month reading and taking notes on textbooks for areas I was uncomfortable with - namely, ACT® Reading and ACT® Science. I first read the Black Book and worked through some of the example problems for Reading and Science listed in the book. Although that book helped a lot, I still was not confident in those sections, so I read The Complete Guide to ACT Reading and For the Love of ACT Science, taking practice ACT® Reading and ACT® Science sections after reading each book to practice the strategies and tips I learned from the textbooks. I spent about 3 hours each day reading textbooks.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the month doing official ACT® tests and reviewing weaknesses and mistakes. I completed 7 more practice tests (about 1 test per 2.5 days). At first, I couldn’t do an entire test in one sitting, but I did manage to do so for my last 2 or 3 tests. During this time, I was still struggling with making careless mistakes and not being fast enough, so that’s what I focused on improving.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How should I study?</summary>
You should allocate your time based on your own strengths and weaknesses. For example, since I was already quite good at English and Math, I didn't need to put much effort into those sections. If you struggle with English and Math, you'll need to put more effort there. As for how long you should study for, the same principle applies. I had all the basics down from the beginning, so a month of study was enough for me. I would recommend not studying for more than a few months, as it's really just diminishing returns at that point. If you know people who say they studied for several months or years and haven't improved enough, they're probably studying wrong, and hopefully you won't do so after reading this guide.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I get x score?</summary>
Yes. I believe that any reasonably intelligent person (I think that’s about 95% of students) can get a 33+ with enough efficient study. The ACT® really is not an advanced test - it tests only very basic concepts and nothing beyond that. We ACT® test takers are very lucky that we don’t have to take the much harder Asian equivalents, such as the Gao Kao (China), CSAT (Korea), the various Indian exams, etc. I believe most people can learn the basics and then practice until they can read the passages and questions quickly and precisely and answer the questions accurately. The only problems are putting in the effort and studying effectively. I can’t help you put in the effort because that’s on you (my advice is to try to find a motivation: college admissions, beating a friend, etc.), but I can help with studying effectively. Don’t half-ass the study process. Don’t just glance over textbooks or watch videos about math while doing something else or do practice problems mindlessly. Instead, take notes on textbooks, ask yourself questions while watching videos and make sure you understand completely, and review your mistakes after doing practice tests. Discover trends in the mistakes you’re making, and figure out a way to ensure that you don’t make those same mistakes again. I am confident that if you study actively for a reasonable amount of time, you can get whatever score you desire.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Which sections are the easiest to improve?</summary>
The general consensus is that English and Math are the easiest to improve since they're content-based. If you miss a question because you didn't understand the concept, all you need to do is learn the concept, and you'll probably get it right next time. It's a bit more difficult to improve Reading and Science since they're skill-based. There's no concept to learn to magically get a question right. Maybe you can learn strategies, but you still have to practice with those strategies and improve your reading abilities, which is harder to do than just learning a grammar or math concept.
</details>

<details>
<summary>ACT or SAT?</summary>
See <a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-vs-sat">this PrepScholar article</a>.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How important are my test scores?</summary>
Your score is just a number that shows how well you can take a certain test and how much knowledge you’ve accumulated from school. It doesn’t define who you are or what you are capable of. This score is ultimately meaningless outside of college admissions, and no one will care about your score after you graduate from high school and get accepted to college (unless you want to work as a tutor). It's important not to think of this score as being more important than it actually is, but it's also important to understand its actual importance. Although ultimately meaningless, these scores carry considerable importance in college admissions. A score falls below your target school’s range of scores (below the 25th percentile) will be a red flag in your college application. A score that’s sufficiently low pretty much denies you entry to that school (for selective schools) unless you have a very good reason for getting that score. A high score, however, will open many doors for you by increasing your college admission chances and can even guarantee you scholarships to some colleges. On the other hand, for really selective colleges, even a 36 won’t guarantee you admission. You should aim to get within your target school’s range of scores (preferably the 75th percentile), and then you should focus on other parts of your college application, such as extracurriculars and essays, both of which become much more important than test scores as soon as you hit that “high enough” score. Generally, a 34+ is good enough for any school.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Is my score good?</summary>
Good/bad is very subjective. If you’re applying to a top 20 university, then a 26 would be considered very bad and, as mentioned before, could bar you admission to that university. If you’re applying to a state university with an average score of 21, however, then a 26 would be very good. If you want to determine whether your score is good or bad, look up your target university’s mid 50% score range (25th percentile score - 75th percentile score) and compare your score to that.

<p>We must start with the most basic definition.</p>

<h3 id="lemma-1-basic-definitions-in-right-triangle">Lemma 1: Basic definitions in right triangle</h3>

<p>In a right triangle, given angle \(\theta\), \(\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)</p>

<p>But it’s definitely best to visualize:</p>

<div class="caption">Basic geometric definition of sine and cosine</div>

<p>From the definitions, we get that the green side is \(h\cos \theta\) because \(\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \implies \text{adjacent} = h\cos \theta\). Similarly, the blue side is \(h\sin \theta\). Letting \(h=1\), the adjacent side is just \(\cos \theta\), and the opposite side is \(\sin \theta\). With this setup, we can show <strong>Lemma 2</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="lemma-2-90-separation">Lemma 2: 90° separation</h3>

<p>\(\cos \theta = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta)\) and \(\sin \theta = \cos(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta)\) for arbitrary \(\theta\)</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. Consider \(\alpha=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta\). In the triangle with hypotenuse 1, the green side is \(\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{1}\). It is also \(\sin \alpha = \frac{\text{opposite}}{1}\). Hence, \(\cos \theta = \sin(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta)\). Similar reasoning holds for the latter identity and for arbitrary \(h\).</p>

<div class="caption">Geometric proof of separation by 90 degrees</div>

<p>Here’s a Desmos graph where you can see the identity for yourself: <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p align="center">
<iframe class="center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/csddcvviru" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="myiFrame" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="600px" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>Back to <strong>Lemma 1</strong>, why should the basic definition be limited to a static right triangle? What about a dynamic right triangle, perhaps one like this: <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p align="center">
<iframe class="center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ko2y1gnr7d" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="myiFrame" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="600px" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>

<p>In this graph, the x coordinates always involve \(\cos \theta\), and the y coordinates always involve \(\sin \theta\). Thinking of the black line as a vector <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we see that to get the horizontal component of the vector, we multiply its length by \(\cos \theta\). To get its vertical component, we multiply its length by \(\sin \theta\). In other words, \(\cos \theta\) projects to \(x\), and \(\sin \theta\) projects to \(y\).</p>

<p>This applies to the graph of a circle as well. Note that, again, \(x\) always goes with \(\cos \theta\), and \(y\) always goes with \(\sin \theta\).</p>

<p align="center">
<iframe class="center" src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jwpjnk3tqk" style="border:0px #ffffff none;" name="myiFrame" scrolling="no" frameborder="1" marginheight="0px" marginwidth="0px" height="400px" width="600px" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>There is an algebraic symmetry that is, in my opinion, as beautiful as the symmetries above. This symmetry also allows us to prove <a href="../eulers-formula/">\(e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x\)</a> for any \(x\).</p>

Consider that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> expansion of \(f(x)\) about the point \(a\) is \(f(a)+f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x-a)^3 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n + \cdots\)</p>

<p>The Maclaurin expansion is the Taylor series centered at \(a=0\), so the Maclaurin expansion of \(f(x)\) is \(f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f'''(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots + \frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n + \cdots\)</p>

<p>Let \(f(x) = \cos x\). We know that <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

\[\begin{matrix}
    f(x) &amp; = &amp; \cos x\\
    f'(x) &amp; = &amp; -\sin x\\
    f''(x) &amp; = &amp; -\cos x\\
    f'''(x) &amp; = &amp; \sin x\\
    f''''(x) &amp; = &amp; \cos x\\
    \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots
\end{matrix}\]

<p>Using that \(\cos(0) = 1\) and \(\sin(0) = 0\), we have that the first few terms of the Maclaurin series are \(1 + 0x -\frac{x^2}{2} + 0x^3 + \frac{x^4}{4!}\). Now, we write the pattern:</p>

\[\cos x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{2n!} x^{2n}\]

<p>Any odd power will have \(\sin(0)=0\) and so can be ignored. Hence, we use only the even numbers \(2n\) in our summation. Using that \(f(x)=\cos x\) and \(f''(x) = -\cos x\), we note that the signs alternate each (even) term, so we also have \((-1)^n\) in the summation.</p>

<p>Similar reasoning holds for \(\sin x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!}x^{2n+1}\).</p>

<p>Lastly, there are also two trigonometric identities that I have always found interesting, in terms of symmetry.</p>

<h3 id="lemma-4-angle-sum-and-difference-identities">Lemma 4: Angle sum and difference identities</h3>

\[\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta)\]

\[\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \cos(\alpha) \sin(\beta)\]

\[\cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) - \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)\]

\[\cos(\alpha - \beta) = \cos(\alpha) \cos(\beta) + \sin(\alpha) \sin(\beta)\]

<p>I won’t prove these identities here, but I will write about the symmetries. Note that the \(\sin\) identities have matching signs; that is, if there is a \(+\) on the left side, there’s a \(+\) on the right side. However, the multiplications are mismatched in that \(\sin\) is multiplied by \(\cos\) and vice versa.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the \(\cos\) identities have matching multiplication in that \(\cos\) multiplies \(\cos\), and \(\sin\) multiplies \(\sin\). The signs, however, are mismatched.</p>

You could expand this out as</p>

\[(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)(x+y)\]

<p>Of course, this would take forever. Is there a better way? <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Consider the following situation: you have 5 boxes, each with one \(x\) and \(y\), and you have to choose one element from each box. How many different ways are there to pick out 2 \(x\)’s and 3 \(y\)’s? In actuality, this is precisely the same question.</p>

<p>Now consider a simpler case, as we should usually do when something appears difficult. What is the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term? Clearly, it is 1. We know that because there’s only one way to get \(x^5\): pick out an \(x\) from each one of the 5 binomials.</p>

<p>Applying this to the \(x^2y^3\) example, we know that its coefficient should be the number of ways to pick out 2 \(x\)’s and 3 \(y\)’s. How many ways is that? We can pick 2 \(x\)’s from the first two, and that would automatically fix 3 \(y\)’s from the last 3 binomials. We could also pick out 2 \(x\)’s from the last two, and that would also automatically give us 3 of \(y\). Does this seem like a familiar concept?</p>

<p>There are \(\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5(4)}{2}=10\) ways to pick out 2 \(x\)’s (fixing 3 \(y\)’s also) from 5 of \((x+y)\). By intuition and the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), we know \(\binom{5}{3}\), which can be interpreted as the number of ways to pick out 3 \(y\)’s and fixing 2 \(x\)’s, is also 10. <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The binomial coefficient naturally has the symmetry \(\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n}{n-k}\), which tells us that if the coefficient of \(x^2y^3\) is \(\binom{5}{2}\) (from 5 boxes pick 2 \(x\)), and the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) is \(\binom{5}{3}\) (from 5 boxes pick 3 \(x\)), then those two numbers are the same. After all, by inspection, why wouldn’t they be? The number of ways to pick out 2 \(x\)’s from 5 of \((x+y)\) is the same as the number of ways to pick out 2 \(y\)’s.</p>

<p>This would also imply the coefficient of \(xy^4\), \(\binom{5}{1}\), should be the same as the coefficient of \(x^4y\), \(\binom{5}{4}\). And, back to where we started, the coefficient of \(x^5\), \(\binom{5}{5}\), is the same as the coefficient of \(y^5\), \(\binom{5}{0}\).</p>

<p>Knowing now that binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{0}, \binom{n}{1}, \ldots ,\binom{n}{n}\) are the coefficients of \((x+y)^n\), what if we arrange these binomial coefficients in a triangle like so:</p>

<p>Well, there’s just one more thing… if we know that the combinatorial and numerical representations of the triangles are the same, then doesn’t that necessarily mean that the addition property that holds for the numerical triangle holds for the binomial coefficient triangle as well? <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> In other words, looking at the middle of the triangle, since \(3+3=6\), \(\binom{3}{1}+\binom{3}{2}=\binom{4}{2}\)? Why?</p>

<p>First, let’s set up the theorem. Let \(\binom{n}{k}\) represent the \(k^{\text{th}}\) entry of the \(n^{\text{th}}\) row of the binomial coefficient form of Pascal’s triangle. Since each number in the numerical Pascal’s triangle is the sum of the two numbers above, we claim that \(\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}\). <sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="lemma-1">Lemma 1</h2>

\[\binom{n}{k}=\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\binom{n-1}{k}\]

<p><em>Proof</em>.</p>

\[\begin{aligned}
\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} &amp;= \frac{(n-1)!}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{(n-1)!}{k!(n-k-1)!}\\ &amp;= (n-1)!\left[\frac{1}{(k-1)!(n-k)!} + \frac{1}{k!(n-k-1)!}\right]\\ &amp;= (n-1)!\left[\frac{k}{k!(n-k)!} + \frac{n-k}{k!(n-k)!}\right]\\ &amp;= (n-1)!\left(\frac{n}{k!(n-k)!}\right)\\ &amp;= \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\\ &amp;= \binom{n}{k}
\end{aligned}\]

<p>You can also head to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_rule#Combinatorial_proof">Wikipedia</a> for a very good combinatorial reasoning (no algebra) proof. I’ll prove another cool identity using combinatorial reasoning:</p>

<h2 id="lemma-2">Lemma 2</h2>

\[k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1}\]

<p><em>Proof</em>. Let \(n\) be the total number of people, and suppose we want to pick out a group of \(k\) people with one special person in the group, perhaps a president. There are two ways for us to accomplish this: (1) select the group first and then within the group, select a president or (2) select a president among all people, then form the rest of the group.</p>

<p>The first way involves first picking out \(k\) people from \(n\) people. There are then \(k\) ways to pick the president from the group of \(k\). By the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/probability-ap/probability-multiplication-rule/a/general-multiplication-rule">multiplication rule</a>, there are \(k\binom{n}{k}\) ways to do this.</p>

<p>The second way is to first pick out a president to be in the group from all \(n\) people, and there are \(n\) such possible presidents. Then, from the remaining \(n-1\) people, we pick out \(k-1\) people (because the president is already included in the group). There are \(n\binom{n-1}{k-1}\) ways to do this.</p>

<p>Hence, by combinatorial reasoning, \(k\binom{n}{k}=n\binom{n-1}{k-1} \quad \blacksquare\)</p>

<h3 id="lemma-1-magnitude-of-expix">Lemma 1: Magnitude of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exp(ix)</code></h3>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number#Conjugate">magnitude</a> of \(e^{ix}\) is \(1 \quad \forall x \in \mathbb{R}\)</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>. We have shown that \(e^{ix}\) is a complex number \(a+bi\), where \(a=\cos x\) and \(b=\sin x \,\). The magnitude of a complex number is its distance, on the complex plane, from \((0, 0)\). We find this distance using the distance formula.</p>

\[|e^{ix}| = |\cos(x) + i\sin(x)| = \sqrt{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)} = \sqrt{1} = 1 \quad \blacksquare\]

<p>The significance of this result is that on the complex plane <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, \(e^{i\theta}\) represents a point that is a distance of one unit away from the origin \((0, 0)\). Varying \(\theta\) from \(0\) to \(2 \pi\) results in the unit circle.</p>

<p>The \(\theta\) parameter measures the counterclockwise angle the point makes with the positive x axis. At this point, since we’re determining a point’s position by its angle, we should wonder how this could be connected with polar coordinates.</p>

<p>A polar coordinate requires an extra parameter, \(r\). Otherwise, we are stuck with only the unit circle and can’t represent points a distance of, for example, 2 units from the origin. We simply add that parameter \(r\) by multiplying by \(r\).</p>

<h3 id="lemma-2-polar-coordinates">Lemma 2: Polar coordinates</h3>

<p>For all points \(x+iy\) on the complex plane, there exist \(r \in \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}\) and \(\theta \in [0, 2 \pi)\) such that \(re^{i\theta} = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) = r\cos \theta + i(r\sin \theta) = x+iy\).</p>

<p>Essentially, \(re^{i\theta}\) represents a polar coordinate with radius \(r\) and angle \(\theta\) on the complex plane.</p>

<h2 id="proof-2-by-differential-equation">Proof 2: By differential equation</h2>

<p>Consider the following differential equation: \(\frac{df(x)}{dx} = if(x)\)</p>

<p>One solution is \(f(x) = e^{ix}\) because \(\frac{d}{dx}e^{ix} = ie^{ix}\)</p>

<p>Another solution is \(f(x) = \cos(x)+i\sin(x)\) because\(\frac{d}{dx}\left(\cos(x)+i\sin(x)\right) = -\sin(x)+i\cos(x) = i\left(\cos(x)+i\sin(x)\right)\)</p>

<p>and both functions satisfy \(f(0) = 1\): \(f(0) = e^{i(0)} = \cos(0) + i\sin(0) = 1\)</p>

<p>Hence, the functions are identical; that is, \(e^{ix} = \cos(x)+i\sin(x) \quad \blacksquare\)</p>

<h3 id="lemma-3-eulers-identity">Lemma 3: Euler’s identity</h3>

\[e^{\pi i} = -1\]

<p><em>Proof</em>.</p>

\[\begin{aligned} e^{\pi i} &amp;= \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi) \\ &amp;= -1 + i(0)\\ &amp;= -1\\ &amp; \blacksquare \end{aligned}\]

<h3 id="lemma-4-ln-1">Lemma 4: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ln(-1)</code></h3>

\[\ln(-1)=i \pi\]

<p><em>Proof</em>. Take the natural log of both sides of Euler’s identity:</p>

\[e^{\pi i} = -1 \implies \pi i = \ln(-1) \quad \blacksquare\]

<p>Then, for example, \(\ln(-23) = \ln(-1) + \ln(23) = \pi i + \ln(23)\).</p>
