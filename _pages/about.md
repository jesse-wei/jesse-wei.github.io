I'm a Master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu) at [UNC](https://unc.edu).

In 2023, I graduated early and with highest distinction from UNC with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.

I am a graduate TA for COMP 311 (Computer Organization). I was a UTA for COMP 311, 210, and 110.

A fun fact about me: I used to [speedcube](/blog/2021/cubing).
