I'm a first-year Master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu) at [UNC](https://unc.edu).

In 2023, I graduated early and with highest distinction from UNC with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science. This summer, I am a Technical Summer Intern at [Teledyne Scientific & Imaging](https://www.teledyne-si.com).

I was a head UTA for COMP 311 (Computer Organization). I was also a UTA for [COMP 210](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/teaching/summer-210/team/team.html) (Data Structures) and [COMP 110](https://22s.comp110.com/resources/team.html) (Introduction to Programming). I received the [Diane Pozefsky Learning Assistant Award](https://cs.unc.edu/about/awards/department-awards/pozefsky-la-award/) in Spring 2023.
