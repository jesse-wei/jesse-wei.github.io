## Description

Cross-platform MIPS assembly emulator for simulating [COMP 541](https://comp541.web.unc.edu) (Digital Logic and Computer Design) final projects.

Runs any MIPS program using the 32 supported MIPS assembly instructions. Simulates memory-mapped I/O devices, including VGA display, accelerometer, and keyboard.

Made in collaboration with Madison Lester over Winter break 2022. Ported from the [original MIPS emulator (C#, Windows-only)](https://github.com/jordanel/mips-emulator) made by Jordan Elliot et al.
